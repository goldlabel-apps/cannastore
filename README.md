### Localhost Symlink Install

Running the unix command `ln` creates a symlink. The idea here is to clone this repo to the same machine as your wordpress install and then symlink the folders to your wp-content directory in order to 

```bash

# SymLinks the theme
ln -s ~/Desktop/Node/cannastore/theme/cannastore ~/Desktop/LAMP/wordpress-5.6/wp-content/themes/

# SymLinks the plugin
ln -s ~/Desktop/Node/cannastore/plugin/cannastore ~/Desktop/LAMP/wordpress-5.6/wp-content/plugins/

```
