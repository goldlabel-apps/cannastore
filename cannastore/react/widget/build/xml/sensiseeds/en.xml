It is characterised by a sweet sandalwood flavour and narcotic effect (minus the couch lock effect).This pure indica seed line originates from the mountainous region of the Hindu Kush. Stretching between Afghanistan to the west and Pakistan to the east, it is a melting pot of old cannabis traditions from the surrounding regions. The Hindu Kush is an El Dorado for genuine indica genotypes and black hashish. Since the destabilisation of the region by American forces, the Hindu Kush has fallen into a touristic deep sleep.Hindu Kush Regular growth patternHindu Kush Regular cannabis seeds have been selected for stability and quality over many generations, breeding exclusively within their own gene pool. The result are dark green, compact and strong plants with the classic broad-bladed leaves of an indica. Hindu Kush Regular yields homogeneous seedlings – it is an excellent strain for uniform harvests. These cannabis plants prefer a dry climate with low humidity. They are resistant to temperature changes and pests, however, which has earned them their reputation as a great plant for novices. It has a comparatively short flowering time of 45 to 50 days. Thanks to a thick layer of trichomes that sparkle like crystals under light, Hindu Kush Regular is predestined for the extraction of kief or hashish.In warmer climate zones, this strain thrives outdoors. If planted under artificial light, the Sea of Green (SOG) cultivation method can maximise yield and cola formation.Effect, flavour and smell of Hindu Kush RegularHindu Kush Regular is a potent strain that produces a typical indica high. Relax your body and mind from the first drag.Its aficionados appreciate the enveloping, pleasantly embedded and narcotic sensation. It’s the perfect strain for a chilled evening on the sofa or before going to sleep. Although Hindu Kush Regular does not trigger complete couch lock, there are better alternatives for during the day.The sweet and earthy sandalwood flavour is typical of indicas from mountainous regions. It goes hand in hand with the relaxed sensations this strain gives you. The smell is reminiscent of wet pine trees and becomes more intense as soon as the plant begins to flower. Did you know?Hindu Kush is considered an evergreen among musicians, artists and actors. Katie Melua even dedicated one of her songs to it. In “Halfway Up The Hindu Kush”, she sings: “You show me lots of things I’ve never seen. You set me free as you’ve taken me halfway up the Hindu Kush.” “High Times” magazine named Hindu Kush from Sensi Seeds one of the best 25 cannabis strains of all time.In addition to these regular (non-feminized) seeds, Hindu Kush is also available as Hindu Kush Feminized and Hindu Kush Automatic.</description><meta_title>Hindu Kush Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Hindu Kush Regular is loved for its sandalwood flavour and its comforting, narcotic effect.

Outside, it grows to prodigious heights, and offers impressively big yields. However, the height can be limited by growing the plants indoors. The buds produce a deliciously earthy, citrusy scent, and the plentiful resin can be used to make extracts. As for Jack Flash’s high? It’s pure sativa – energetic, creative and uplifting. Growth pattern of Jack Flash RegularJack Flash Regular cannabis seeds are an almost balanced combination of sativa (45%) and indica (55%). The strain was created by Sensi Seeds, who took their original Jack Herer genetics, and crossed them with Haze and Super Skunk. The result is an energising, happy high that’s pure Jack Herer, combined with the many benefits of indica strains. These cannabis seeds are the regular variety, which means they’ll produce both male and female plants. This is ideal for those who want to generate their own seeds, or who want to experiment with breeding plants themselves. Jack Flash Regular requires an average amount of time to complete its flowering. Growers can anticipate the flowering stage to take around 70 days in total. When cultivated outdoors, the plants can reach staggering heights. In fact, it’s not uncommon for them to grow as tall as 180 to 250 cm. Inside, they’re less towering, and in optimum growing conditions, they can be limited to around 100 cm. On average, growers should expect them to be around 100 to 180 cm when cultivated indoors. When it comes to the structure of the plants, this strain has the tendency to ‘bush out’ like an indica. It produces substantial yields, both indoors and out. Inside, growers report harvesting around 500 grams per square metre. Outside, grow reports mention about 600 grams per plant, which is much more plentiful than average sativa harvests. The plants have a highly distinctive bud formation. The mould-resistant buds are large and densely-packed, and form resinous ropes. For best results, expert growers usually recommend cultivating Jack Flash Regular in a warm, sunny climate, with a reliably long summer. The plants also grow well inside, and respond favourably to the supercropping and lollipopping training techniques. Effect, taste, and smell of Jack Flash RegularJack Flash Regular is a 55% indica and 45% sativa strain. Although it’s an almost even split, the high is very much sativa in personality. Users report feeling euphoric and uplifted, and often chatty and creative too. In fact, it’s a popular choice for social situations. Users should be aware that the effects are almost immediate, and extremely potent – so some caution is advised for inexperienced users.While the plants are growing, they produce a skunky, pungent aroma. While this is noticeable, it’s not overpowering, which is useful when cultivating in the home. The smell intensifies as the buds reach harvest-time, taking on a more dank, intense quality. As for the taste? It’s regarded as quite pleasant, with hints of citrus and exotic wood. Did you know? Jack Flash is a prize-winning strain: It has won awards at the Denver Cannabis Cup, and the Highlife Festival. It’s referenced in the song ‘Over the Pot (State of Grind)’ by Gast.The popular Jack Herer strain is one of this variety’s parent-plants.Thanks to its indica genetics, it’s easier to grow than other sativa-hybridised plants. However, pruning these plants requires more expertise.</description><meta_title>Jack Flash Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Jack Flash Regular is 45% sativa and 55% indica.

The 90% indica plants are easy to grow both indoors and outside, and are compact and fast-flowering. Growers can expect plenty of fat, glistening buds, and big yields too. The scent is pleasantly aromatic; earthy, rich and with a hint of honey. The high is also formidable, and is powerfully relaxing for the body and the mind. Growth pattern of Northern Lights Regular Northern Lights Regular cannabis seeds are 90% indica and 10% sativa. The multi-award-winning strain is thought to have originated in the States, before being taken to The Netherlands. There, Sensi Seeds developed it into the variety that it is today, enhancing its Afghani and Thai genetics. The seeds are regular, so growers will be able to generate both female and male plants from the pack. This is a good option for those who want to produce seeds of their own, or who want to experiment with cross-breeding. The plants have a rapid flowering time of just 45 to 50 days, which means that growers can enjoy a fairly speedy harvest. As with many indica-dominant strains, Northern Lights Regular is compact, with plants remaining fairly small both indoors and outdoors. When grown inside, the plants’ height is normally limited to around 80 to 130 cm. Outside, they may grow taller, but probably no higher than 150 to 200 cm. The plants are sturdy and squat in appearance, with multiple branches and leaves. This is fortunate, as they’re able to support the sizeable, resinous buds. These buds usually result in a big yield. Growers cultivating Northern Lights Regular inside can expect to generate about 500 grams per square metre. As for plants grown outdoors in the right conditions? Some growers have reported harvesting as much as 1.5 kilos from a single plant!Northern Lights Regular needs plenty of sunlight and warmth to reach its full potential. As such, the plants need to be grown in a country that benefits from long, hot summers. The Mediterranean is the ideal sort of location for this strain. Alternatively, the plants can be grown indoors all year round, anywhere in the world. More experienced growers claim that the lollipopping and supercropping training methods are effective with this strain, and boost the harvests even higher. Effect, taste, and smell of Northern Lights Regular Northern Lights Regular is 90% indica, and its genetics come through clearly in the resulting high. Users report an intense, total-body stone with this strain, which relaxes the muscles and calms the mind. The scent is also typically indica in nature; pungent, deep and earthy. However, there’s a hint of honey and herb to the smell too, which becomes more noticeable as the buds reach harvest-time. The plants don’t usually produce an overpowering scent while growing, which is useful for those who want to cultivate them discreetly. Upon consumption, users can anticipate a rich, aromatic flavour, with the notes of sweetness coming through fairly strongly. Did you know? Northern Lights Regular by Sensi Seeds is a multiple-award-winning strain.It’s one of the most influential varieties available, and is often used as a parent for further strains. Northern Lights Regular comes in two other variants; Northern Lights Feminized and Northern Lights Automatic.The strain is relatively easy to cultivate, but a level of experience is required for generating bumper harvests.</description><meta_title>Northern Lights Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Northern Lights Regular is 90% indica, 10% sativa award-winning strain.

A dream strain with a mild hashish taste.The reason why indica strains from the Hindu Kush are known as hash plants is due to their immense resin content. Once harvested, they are rolled by hand into balls and sold as “charas”. Hash Plant Regular is based on a premium quality, extremely sticky Afghan strain. But that wasn’t enough: prior to market launch, Sensi Seeds tested a few crosses and backcrosses with the Northern Lights #1.Hash Plant Regular growth patternThe result is a 90% indica that is based on 75% of the original Hash Plant and 25% on a Northern Lights #1. Hash Plant Regular seeds produce female and male cannabis plants with a typical indica growth pattern. Thanks to their extremely compact size, they take up only minimal space in the growing room. During the (possibly record) flowering time, which lasts 40 to 45 days, the resin-drenched buds develop, packed with valuable cannabinoids.Good ventilation is essential to prevent mould formation. This applies equally to feeding the plants: they have a very healthy appetite when in flower. Apart from this, Hash Plant Regular is an easy-to-grow cannabis strain that is both robust and resilient.The biggest yields are achieved with a Sea of Green (SOG), where several small plants stand next to each other. Clones from the same mother plant are ideal. But in conventional set-ups, these plants enjoy lush harvests – without the added care and attention that other strains require.The heavy, resinous buds retain their weight after drying. These can be pressed into hashish, or enjoyed as dried weed. Effect, flavour and smell of Hash Plant RegularIt’s the combination of sedative effect and creative energy that makes this strain so popular. It stimulates productive evenings and long conversations among good company as much as a peaceful night’s sleep. In common with many other indica strains from the Hindu Kush, the Hash Plant contains CBD in addition to THC.The sweet Afghan hashish scent evokes a sense of nostalgia among older users. Just like the aroma of a night in Anjuna or Manali! The smoke is thick and heavy, and is accompanied by a spicy sharpness.Did you know?Hash Plant Regular is a multi-award-winning cannabis strain. It won prizes at the Highlife Festival in 2002 and at the Copa de la Marihuana in 2004.</description><meta_title>Hash Plant Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Hash Plant Regular seeds produce compact, robust plants with a very short flowering time of around 45 days. 90% indica genes and a relaxing high.</meta_description><url><![CDATA[https://sensiseeds.com/en/cannabis-seeds/sensi-seeds/hash-plant]]></url><image><![CDATA[https://img.sensiseeds.com/en/cannabis-seeds/sensi-seeds/hash-plant-thumb.png]]></image><price>132</price><currency>eur</currency><in_stock>Yes</in_stock><category>Indoor</category><flowering_min>40</flowering_min><flowering_max>45</flowering_max><strain_type>Regular</strain_type><number_of_seeds>10</number_of_seeds><climate_zone>Sunny / Mediterranean</climate_zone><yield>Large Yield</yield><heigh_gain>Compact plant</heigh_gain></item><item><itemtype>Product</itemtype><id>1500005</id><title>Black Domina Regular Seeds</title><description>Black Domina Regular cannabis seeds comprise 95% indica genes. They produce compact, very dark cannabis plants with a central main cola. This is matched by the aroma of black hashish with notes of blackberry. Not two, not three, but four legendary indica strains were involved in the development of Black Domina Regular. The exceptional resin production and narcotic effect originates from the Northern Lights. These properties are further underpinned by the Ortega. Our breeders also added a hash plant to the mix – a strain valued for its short flowering time and bumper harvests. The little-known but all-the-more-valuable Afghani SA guarantees robust growth and high resistance to mould and disease.Black Domina Regular growth patternIf you grow these seeds, you should expect a certain diversity of phenotypes. The indica characteristics always dominate, which is hardly surprising with 95% indica genes. The speed, density and impressive resin production make all Domina feminized varieties potentially suitable and productive mother plants. What’s the first thing you notice when you look at the Black Domina Regular? The dark colour of course, from which the strain takes its name. The black and green leaves are as eye-catching as the dark purple stripes on the buds, which are covered with a shiny layer of trichomes. These cannabis seeds produce compact plants with a solid central cola. After a comparatively short flowering time of around 50 days, Black Domina yields a big harvest. This lady feels most comfortable under artificial light. Outdoor cultivation will succeed only if it stays light and warm for long enough during the summer. Black Domina Regular is otherwise easy to grow and responds generously to advanced cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Supercropping and Lollipopping.Effect, flavour and smell of Black Domina RegularNever underestimate the strength of this Domina strain. Its dulling, some would say narcotic, effect is legendary. It’s definitely not a good choice if you have a busy day, which means that this weed is all the more suitable for a chilled evening on the sofa.In terms of taste, you can look forward to savoury aromas that perfectly match the character of this strain. Pepper and black hashish are mixed with a hint of blackberry, which is reflected in both the flavour and the smell. The bouquet of aromas is rounded off with earthy Afghan tones.Did you know?For novices and growers wanting something even easier, this cannabis strain is also available as Black Domina Feminized.</description><meta_title>Black Domina Regular Seeds - Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Black Domina Regular is a potent indica strain (95%) whose effect is comparable with a narcotic.

Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant Regular grows well indoors, or in sunny, warm climates. Growers can expect bumper harvests, both inside and out. Growth pattern of Mr Nice G13 X Hash Plant Regular Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant cannabis seeds are 100% indica. The strain includes G13 in its genetics; a premium Afghani plant that (according to legend) was smuggled out of a government research centre by a technician. Sensi Seeds developed the strain with a focus on enhancing G13 further, and the result was Mr Nice, which was released in 1999. This pack features regular seeds, which produce both male and female plants. This enables growers to cultivate their own seeds for future planting, or for cross-breeding with other strains. Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant Regular has a flowering time of 60 to 65 days.Unsurprisingly, given its indica genetics, this strain doesn’t grow to significant heights. However, when grown outdoors, it’s not uncommon for the plants to reach about 190 to 240 cm. Inside, they’re much more compact, with the average plant growing to approximately 80 to 170 cm. Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant is robust in appearance, with a thick central stem and plenty of bushy branches. The buds are big and weighty, and covered with glittering trichomes. They tend to gather around the main stem. As with other indica varieties, the yields tend to be sizeable. When grown indoors, Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant will produce around 400 grams per square metre. Outside, experienced growers can sometimes generate as much as 1 kilo per plant. The strain flourishes best in warm, sunny locations, and needs a long summer to reach its full potential. However, it can be grown successfully indoors (all year round) in any location in the world. It’s a good candidate for supercropping and lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Mr Nice G13 X Hash Plant Regular Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant Regular provides an incredibly potent body-stone. It’s 100% indica, and this shows in the ‘couch-lock’ effect, with users reporting feeling ultra-relaxed and soothed after consuming it.

The award-winning NL5 X Haze plants are 70% sativa, 30% indica, and can produce bountiful yields, year after year. They reach impressive heights, even indoors, and have a pleasantly spicy, sweet scent. Upon consuming, users report feeling euphoric to start with, then blissfully relaxed for a long time afterwards.Growth pattern of Northern Lights #5 x HazeNorthern Lights #5 x Haze cannabis seeds (or NL5 x Haze for short) are a blend of 70% sativa and 30% indica. This combination results in a plant that’s capable of reaching massive heights, and which produces plenty of dense buds. Although the hybrid strain was developed several years ago, it remains a firm favourite with growers across the globe. This is the regular variant of NL5 x Haze, which means the seeds will produce both male and female plants. The advantage of this is that the plants can be used to generate seeds for future grows. They can also be used to experiment with further hybridisation. Northern Lights #5 x Haze has a slightly longer flowering time of 65 to 75 days. As the plants mature, they grow extremely tall. This is especially the case when grown outdoors, with some growers reporting that their plants reach as high as 250 to 300 cm. Indoors, the height is less extensive, with average plants growing to around 120 to 170 cm, depending on when it is put into flowering. The strain is typically sativa in appearance, with long branches, but these are soon concealed by the densely packed, plentiful buds. As time goes on, the buds develop a sticky, resinous coating, more reminiscent of an indica than a sativa. One of the main attractions of Northern Lights #5 x Haze is its extra-large yields. When cultivated indoors, growers can anticipate harvesting around 450 grams per square metre. Outdoors, experienced growers report that the yield can be as much as 800 grams per plant. Due to its extended flowering period, NL5 x Haze needs to grow in a country that has long, warm summers. It can be grown indoors all year round. Growers often keep their plants small by changing the lights to 12/12 h after germination. Both supercropping and lollipopping deliver good results with this strain. Effect, taste, and smell of Northern Lights #5 x HazeNorthern Lights #5 x Haze is a sativa-dominant strain. This is immediately noticeable in the high, which is euphoric, social and happy. However, the indica genetics kick in a while later, when users report a total-body sense of relaxation, which lasts a long time. The strain’s aroma is fairly potent, especially towards harvesting. It’s sweet, exotic and spicy, and the Haze scent really comes through after the buds have been cured. Expect much the same in terms of taste, and be aware that the smell produced when smoking NL5 x Haze is quite powerful! Did you know?Northern Lights #5 x Haze is an award-winning strain. It’s won the High Times Cannabis Cup and the High Life Cup, among others. The strain works well for cloning.Northern Lights #5 x Haze is often referred to as NL5 x Haze.

The lasting effect is felt in both the mind and the body; another reason why Jack has made a name for itself as a medicinal cannabis strain.Jack Herer® Regular growth patternWith 50% sativa and 50% indica genes, Jack Herer® Regular belongs to the group of cannabis hybrids. The attributes of one or the other dominate depending on the phenotype, allowing growers to select mother plants according to their preference. Three of the four main types are heavily sativa-influenced, while the fourth demonstrates indica-dominated growth behaviour: fast-growing, compact, with a thick bud structure. The fantastic resin production of this cannabis strain amazes even experienced growers. At their peak, the buds are so heavy with trichomes that they look as though they have been glazed. This crystal coating extends to the spear leaves, fan leaves and even to the main stems and stalks. All the phenotypes have the potential to produce a lush yield per metre, though growing experience definitely makes a difference with this strain. On average, it takes 10 to 12 weeks until harvest. Experts can optimise their results with a Sea of Green (SOG) or Screen of Green (SCROG) to improve the plants’ yield and restrict their height gain. Jack likes it hot – in Mediterranean or tropical climates it will also thrive outside in the sun. Effect, flavour and smell of Jack Herer® Regular	Are you ready for a full charge of hybrid power?

The strain is indica-dominant (85%), which means users are guaranteed a blissed-out, relaxing high. One of Big Bud’s most notable features is its enormous, crystal-coated buds, which produce a wonderfully sweet, molasses-like aroma and taste. The comparatively short flowering time is great for those who want quick results. Growth pattern of Big Bud RegularBig Bud Regular cannabis seeds are 85% indica and 15% sativa. As such, the plants have strongly indica-dominant characteristics, both in appearance, and in the high. The strain has an interesting history. Originally, it was bred in the US, from a robust Afghanica and a skunk plant. Thanks to its prolific harvests, it swiftly became a much-loved commercial variety. Big Bud remained popular in the States, until the War on Drugs forced breeders to smuggle it to the Netherlands, where it was further stabilised. Through considerable research, Sensi Seeds took Big Bud right back to its roots, capturing the sturdiness and sweet aroma of the original. Now, its genetics feature Skunk #1 and Northern Lights – two well-established and popular strains. There are feminized or automatic versions of Big Bud available. However, this is a regular variant, which makes it ideal for those that want to produce their own seeds, or experiment with producing different strains. The plants have a comparatively short flowering time of around 50 to 65 days. When grown outdoors, they’re usually harvested around mid- to late October. Big Bud tends to grow to average heights. Inside, plants can be anything from 80 to 160 cm, which is good news for those who live in a smaller home. Outdoors, the plants can reach heights of 180 to 200 cm, which may require a bit more space. This fungus and pest-resistant strain is typically quite narrow in structure, with not as many leaves as other cannabis plants, and enormous buds. Most of these buds grow around the main stem, which makes harvesting easier. The yield is what really appeals to growers, though. Indoors, yields of 500 to 600 g/m² are often reported, and outdoors, this can reach as high as 800 to 1200 grams per plant. Expect plenty of enormous buds with Big Bud Regular. They’re dense and heavy; so heavy in fact, that they sometimes snap the branches they’re growing on if left unsupported. The buds are also covered in thick, shining resin, which gives some indication of the potent high that users can enjoy after harvesting. Big Bud flourishes in warm, sunny climates, such as the Mediterranean. Alternatively, it can be grown indoors, all year round. It responds exceptionally well to supercropping and lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Big Bud RegularBig Bud Regular has strong indica genetics, and this heritage is obvious upon consumption. Users can anticipate a full-body, sedative high, with just a touch of euphoria, thanks to the 15% sativa influence. The strain is prized for its sweet aroma while growing, which some compare to the scent of molasses; sugary, with a hint of spice. Once the buds are harvested, this smell intensifies noticeably. The rich, sweet flavour is also evident in the taste. Did you know? Big Bud Regular is one of Sensi Seed’s biggest yielding strains, with bumper crops that are sure to impress most growers. It’s also available in two other variants; Big Bud Feminized and Big Bud Auto.Big Bud was first developed in the US, in the 1980s. It’s a popular commercial choice, thanks to its prolific harvests.

Small doses are enough for a maximum relaxing effect. Even novices can’t go wrong with this cannabis strain - although that shouldn’t put off experienced growers, of course. If you’re looking for a resinous strain with plentiful yields, this is it.Cannabis indica may be named after India, but the best examples of these dark, ultra-resinous genotypes grow in the mountains of Afghanistan. Fans call these strains Afghanica or Hash Plant. As the name suggests, they form the basis of high-quality hashish (Charas). Fortunately, there’s no need to travel half-way around the world to get hold of it now. Simply order a few Afghani #1 Regular cannabis seeds from Sensi Seeds. Afghani #1 Regular growth patternThe best parent plants of our Afghan strains have been distilled into a single seed strain that delivers prime examples of the indica genotype every time. Growers seeking a fast-growing indoor strain with plentiful yields and formidable resin production will love these seeds. Whether you want consistent harvests from seed or pure indica mother plants for clones, Afghani #1 Regular is the perfect solution!You can expect robust, medium-sized plants with strong branches and lush foliage. Give them at least eight weeks to grow. The flowering phase lasts around seven to nine weeks. Growth is limited, as is typical of indica. You can expect your plants to more or less double in size. When the resin-covered buds and pistils gradually turn from white to orange, you will know that it is time to harvest. The entire main stem of the plant will have changed into a single, resin-covered flower cluster. The smaller buds on the lower parts of the plant will boost your yield, so make sure you pluck them as well. You can look forward to large, compact, heavy buds that retain their weight even after drying. To increase your yield even further, you could try a Sea of Green (SOG).Afghani #1 Regular is very easy to grow, but you should remember that this strain is designed for indoor cultivation. These plants will only thrive outside in a Mediterranean climate with long, hot summers.Effect, flavour and smell of Afghani #1 RegularBecause Afghani #1 has a long-lasting effect, it is particularly suitable for a chilled-out evening on the sofa. The narcotic stone effect should not be underestimated. Novices may find it soporific. For other users, the combination of a deep sense of relaxation and mental wellbeing will feel like a holiday. Make sure you have a few snacks to hand.The traditional aroma of this strain, comprising earthy tones and light notes of fruits and pepper, will transport old-school cannabis users back to their first hashish experiences. Did you know?Afghan indicas paved the way for the success of modern-day cannabis cultivation. Many of the hybrid strains that dominate the market today owe their growth structure, resin production and fast flowering to the Afghan strains. In addition to these regular seeds, Afghani #1 is also available as Afghani #1 Automatic and Afghani #1 Feminized.</description><meta_title>Afghani #1 Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>The many resinous buds of Afghani #1 Regular are perfect for hashish production, but beware of the pronounced indica stone effect!</meta_description><url><![CDATA[https://sensiseeds.com/en/cannabis-seeds/sensi-seeds/afghani-1]]></url><image><![CDATA[https://img.sensiseeds.com/en/cannabis-seeds/sensi-seeds/afghani-1-thumb.png]]></image><price>54.99</price><currency>eur</currency><in_stock>Yes</in_stock><category>Indoor</category><flowering_min>45</flowering_min><flowering_max>55</flowering_max><strain_type>Regular</strain_type><number_of_seeds>10</number_of_seeds><climate_zone>Sunny / Mediterranean</climate_zone><yield>Heavy Yield</yield><heigh_gain>Average height gain</heigh_gain></item><item><itemtype>Product</itemtype><id>1500011</id><title>Maple Leaf Indica Regular Seeds</title><description>Maple Leaf Indica Regular isn’t just any random strain: it represents a piece of cannabis history. Fans will recognise the classic Afghan flavour as much as the disarming body stone. 100% indica for nostalgic flights into past highs. Long before Afghanistan became an international political football, it was the Mecca of hippies and cannabis fans. In Mazar i-Sharif, they filled up on stuffed flat bread (Lavash) and vermicelli pudding with dates (sheer khurma). The local hashish was of such good quality that new arrivals immediately put off their onward journey to Goa. What followed were years of Soviet and American suppression. It’s all thanks to a collector that the Maple Leaf parents could be smuggled out of the country just in time. The exodus of Afghan genetics laid the foundation for modern cannabis cultivation. It’s only because of this that many Sensi Seeds hybrids are even possible. Maple Leaf Indica Regular growth patternMaple Leaf Indica Regular originates from one of the region’s few surviving strains. The dried buds provide the substance for premium quality hashish. This is a fast-flowering strain, with an average flowering time of 45 to 50 days. The plants are compact in growth. They are characterised by large leaves and heavy buds that ooze resin. They have a high potential yield, without the added care and attention that other strains require. The plants are not really affected by cultivation mistakes, though it’s worth keeping a keen eye on pests. Experienced growers can optimise their yields with a Sea of Green (SOG). If the climate permits, these regular seeds also thrive outdoors. Given the best conditions, they grow into giant bushes with mighty upper branches. Effect, flavour and smell of Maple Leaf Indica RegularThe stone effects of this strain hit the body with full force. Because every muscle fibre in the body relaxes, there is a pleasing sense of weightiness. Larger amounts can send users into a deep sleep. Pure indicas such a Maple Leaf Regular result in a pleasant warmth, leaving the body feeling like it’s wrapped in cotton wool. Given such impressive amounts of resin, a complex aromatic bouquet comes as no surprise. Depending on the phenotype, citrus, orange or grapefruit accents may dominate. The caramelly sweetness, from which this strain takes its name, leaves a buttery after-taste. The flavour experience is finished with the earthy notes that are typical of indicas.Did you know?THC-rich hybrid strains dominate the cannabis scene today. The trendy new strains too often forget that they owe many of their characteristics to Afghan strains. For example, the fast flowering, the tendency towards trichome formation and the growth structure all go back to Afghanistan.</description><meta_title>Maple Leaf Indica Regular Cannabis Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Maple Leaf Indica Regular is 100% based on premium indica genetics from Afghanistan.

It’s an affordable, easy-to-grow strain which grows to average heights, and thrives in sunny climates. Growers often enjoy its sweet, sour aroma, and the pungent, skunky taste. Most people benefit from a big yield with Shiva Shanti Regular, without having to put too much effort in.Growth pattern of Shiva Shanti RegularShiva Shanti Regular cannabis seeds have mostly indica genetics. The strain was developed in the 1990s to celebrate the formation of the Sensi Seed Bank, and was bred from an Afghani plant called Garlic Bud, and a classic Kush variety.This is the regular variant of the strain, which makes it the preferred choice for growers wishing to generate their own seeds. In this pack, the seeds produce both male and female plants. Regular seeds are also suitable for those who want to experiment with cross-breeding with other strains.Shiva Shanti Regular has a relatively short flowering time, of just 50 to 55 days. This means that growers can reach the harvest stage relatively speedily. Thanks to their indica genetics, the plants don’t tend to reach towering heights; in fact, when grown indoors, it’s possible to limit their growth to just 100 to 160 cm. Outside, it’s likely that they’ll grow taller – to around 190 to 220 cm on average.Structurally, the plants are quite bushy, with dark, narrow leaves. They can be squat in appearance, with a thick central stem. Most of the buds form around this stem, and they’re usually large and dense. They’re also compact, and often spear-shaped. Growers report obtaining plentiful harvests from Shiva Shanti Regular, without having to put in too much effort. When cultivated inside, an average yield is about 500 gram per square metre, and outdoors, it’s around 500 grams per plant.This strain does particularly well in warm, sunny climates, like the Mediterranean. Due to their kush heritage, the plants are usually ready to harvest around late September / early October. They can also be grown indoors (all year round), or in a greenhouse. Their average height means that low ceilings or greenhouse roofs shouldn’t be an issue. Supercropping and lollipopping are both effective training techniques for Shiva Shanti Regular, and deliver good results. However, most growers can enjoy sizeable harvests without too much effort at all. Effect, taste, and smell of Shiva Shanti RegularShiva Shanti Regular is indica-dominant, and this comes through in the resulting high. It’s a potent, total-body stone, which users claim is calming, while also enhancing the physical senses. The 15% sativa influence adds a hint of uplift too. The plants don’t produce too much odour, which is useful for those who want to grow them without drawing any unwanted attention. However, they do produce some scent, and this is typically sour and sweet, with a skunky edge. After curing, the smell is less noticeable, but the tang of skunk is still very evident in the taste. Did you know?Shiva Shanti Regular was named after Sensi Seeds’ founder Ben Dronkers’ twin daughters. It also took its name from the Hindu god, who is commonly associated with cannabis. Some of the phenotypes release a noticeable garlicky scent.Due to Shiva Shanti Regular’s average height and unobtrusive aroma, it’s a favourite among growers that want to cultivate the plants discreetly. It’s considered an easy-to-maintain variety, which means it’s a popular choice for novice growers.</description><meta_title>Shiva Shanti Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Shiva Shanti Regular is 85% indica.

It was developed from several other high-performing strains, which makes it perfect for further cross-breeding. Expect big yields from Four-Way, especially indoors, or outside in warm, sunny conditions. Growers particularly enjoy its strong, spicy aroma, and the taste, which has a hint of peppery sweetness. Growth pattern of Four-Way RegularFour-Way Regular cannabis seeds are 80% indica and 20% sativa. This strain is the result of several years of careful hybridisation, with a focus on creating a stable end-product that showcased the benefits of the parent-plants. With each successive generation, specific plants were back-crossed for further stabilisation, or introduced to the next genotype. Finally, Four-Way was perfected – a hybrid featuring Afghani, Pakistani and Indian genetics, combined with Skunk #1.It’s a regular variant, which means that the seeds produce both female and male plants. The presence of male plants is useful for those who want to generate seeds for future grows, or for their own cross-breeding experiments. As a multiple hybrid, growers should anticipate some variation in the plants, which can result in exciting trait combinations.Four-Way Regular has a relatively short flowering time (45 to 60 days), which is another big benefit. This means that growers can enjoy swift results, and may even be able to get multiple harvests each year. The strain is fairly compact, with plants only reaching around 100 to 180 cm when grown inside. Outdoors, in the right conditions, they’re likely to grow taller – to around 180 to 250 cm. However, this is still manageable in an average garden. The plants are appealing to the eye, with plentiful buds gathered mostly around the central stem, and long, elegant leaves. The buds are heavy-looking and tightly packed, with a generous coating of shining resin. The yield is another notable aspect of Four-Way Regular. The plants don’t tend to require too much maintenance, and offer good harvests even for novice growers. When cultivated inside, people report gathering approximately 500 grams per square metre. Outdoors, the average harvest is about 500 grams per plant. Four-Way Regular performs well in sunny climates, and needs long, warm summers to reach its true potential. However, it’s also easy to cultivate indoors under artificial lighting, and can also be grown in a greenhouse. Experienced growers may find that supercropping and lollipopping are both effective training techniques with this strain. Effect, taste, and smell of Four-Way RegularFour-Way Regular is indica-dominant, with limited sativa genetics. As such, its high is normally typically indica in personality; a potent total-body stone, which users claim is relaxing and sedative. Although the seeds produce different phenotypes, the plants are usually sweet-smelling, with a hint of peppery spiciness. There’s also a touch of earthiness, which becomes more prominent as the buds approach harvest-time. Users describe the taste as sweet and spicy, with notes of soil and skunk, thanks to the Skunk #1 influence. Did you know?Four-Way Regular is a multiple hybrid, which means there may be some variation when the plants are grown from seed. Although variation is likely, most of the plants tend to share common features, such as large, fat buds. Four-Way Regular gets its name from the fact that its genetics feature four strains; an Afghani, a Pakistani, an Indian, and Skunk #1. Some growers claim that the aroma isn’t much like a typical indica.Four-Way Regular was re-launched back in 1995, and has been a favourite of growers since then.</description><meta_title>Four-Way Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Four-Way Regular is 80% indica.

Under the same conditions, they grow less tall than sativas, which is an advantage in small growing spaces in particular. The buds are thicker, heavier and ready for harvest sooner. Thanks to their highly robust nature, indicas are – unlike most sativa strains – also suitable for novices.The Indoor Mix Regular offers a good chance to raise high-quality mother plants, and breed clones from them. Effect, flavour and smell of Indoor Mix RegularIndicas trigger a body-centric body stone. They emphasise sensory impressions, and have a relaxing effect; in larger quantities, they can have a soporific effect.Sativas are at the other end of the spectrum of effect. The high is felt more in the mind. Many users feel they have more energy. Thoughts become clearer and sharper. Sativa strains are particularly popular among creative types. Cannabinoids and terpenes, which are found in different ratios and volumes in all Sensi Seeds strains, are responsible for the effect and flavour of cannabis. The most important of these are THC and CBD, only the first of which is psychoactive.Did you know?For people who prefer to grow seeds outdoors, we offer our Outdoor Mix Seeds.

Genetically, this tall-growing cannabis strain is based on 75% sativa genes. Accordingly, the uplifting effect is evident primarily in the mind. Silver Haze Regular Growth PatternThe original Haze strains were hugely popular in the 1970s. They were loved for their strong, almost psychedelic effect that was perfectly in tune with the upcoming hippie movement of the time. Although people of the flower power age loved the cracking rush, Haze was soon threatened with extinction. Too slow, yields that were too small, plants growing too high: such was the damning opinion of indoor growers who stirred up the scene in the 1980s. But then came Silver Haze. Sensi Seeds successfully created a seed line which combines the entire Haze experience in a more compact and faster form. Together with its big sister, Northern lights #5 X Haze, Silver Haze saved the psychedelic sativas from disappearing. The extreme height gain and long flowering stage were brought under control by crossing it with a Northern Lights. The dark indica also adds weight to the scales, which benefits the light and fragile structure of the original Haze. With 75% sativa genes, Silver Haze is of course still a tall-growing plant – expect it to grow to more than three times its original height during flowering. But this also means that seedlings and clones can very quickly be forced to flower in closed cultivation facilities. The best results can be achieved with a Screen of Green (SCROG). Silver Haze Regular also responds well to Supercropping and Lollipopping. Outdoor cultivation should be considered only in warm climates with long summers.The plants take around 65 to 75 days to flower. When the buds are covered with a sticky, silvery layer of trichome, it’s harvest time.Effect, Flavour and Smell of Silver Haze RegularAfter lighting up, it’s just a few moments before the Haze high sets in. Euphoric, creative and happy are words repeatedly heard in this context. Note that this is a strain that has a high THC content.Creative people have long valued Haze strains as a source of inspiration. Whether in the morning, during the day or in the evening – Silver Haze is suitable for any time of the day, although there are better alternatives just before bedtime.Depending on the phenotype, the smell and taste range from earthy, pine-like and sweet to woody with a hint of mint and citrus.Did you know?Silver Haze took first place at the High Times Cannabis Cup 1989. We’re even happier about the many positive customer votes we’ve received since then.For even easier growing, this cannabis strain is also available as Silver Haze Feminized.</description><meta_title>Silver Haze Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Silver Haze Regular is a modern classic of cannabis cultivation.

It produces generous yields without too much effort, which makes it a solid option for beginners. The plants produce a pleasantly spicy, tangy aroma that’s reminiscent of hashish. They can be restricted to relatively compact sizes when grown indoors, which is useful for growers who want to cultivate the plants discreetly.Growth pattern of First Lady RegularFirst Lady Regular cannabis seeds are 95% indica, 5% sativa. The strain offers the rich, old-school scent and high of a classic Afghani, combined with the robustness of a modern variant. The Hindu Kush heritage comes through in the growth pattern and quality of the buds. The seeds are regular, which offers a number of benefits. As they produce both female and male plants, they’re capable of generating more seeds, which can be used for future grows. The seeds are also suitable for cross-breeding with other strains. Like many indica-dominant strains, First Lady Regular has a fast flowering time, of just 45 to 50 days. This means that growers can harvest the plants speedily. The height of the plants is quite variable. When cultivated indoors, they’re relatively compact (around 80 to 160 cm), but outdoors, can reach heights of 250 to 300 cm. In terms of appearance, it’s a bushy, dense-looking variety, with lots of leaves and branches. The plants usually produce plenty of buds, which are heavy and covered in resin. They yield sizeable harvests too. Growers can expect to obtain as much as 550 grams per square metre when growing First Lady Regular inside, and 800 grams per plant when cultivating it outdoors. It’s a relatively low-maintenance strain, and even novice growers should be able to generate a good yield without too much expertise or hard work. However, First Lady Regular does require plenty of sun and warmth. As such, the plants need to be grown in a location like the Mediterranean if they’re being planted outside. Indoors, they can be cultivated anywhere, all year round. Experienced growers report getting good results with both the supercropping and lollipopping training techniques. Effect, taste, and smell of First Lady RegularFirst Lady Regular is 95% indica. Its Afghani / Hindu Kush genetics are immediately obvious in the high, which is relaxing and sedating, both for the body and the mind. It’s not an overpowering stone, and users prize its calming effect. Be aware, it can make users hungry! The plants produce a warm, spicy scent that’s reminiscent of high-quality hashish. This aroma can be quite pungent, particularly after the buds have cured. The hashy, incense-flavoured smell can also be detected in the taste. Did you know? First Lady Regular gets its name because it’s one of the fastest flowering regular seeds available. It’s a resiliant, robust strain, making it a viable choice even for those with no previous growing experience.

Unlike Jack, Mother's Finest Regular tends more towards Haze. 70% sativa and 30% indica genes give growers a good idea of what to expect. A sativa hybrid with a flowering time of 50 to 70 days, and elegant, tall-growing plants. The characteristic conical shape of the buds becomes evident early on. They mature into impressive lime-green formations surrounded by the finest resin. Some phenotypes form a mighty main cola. During the flowering stage in particular, these plants gain rapidly in height. Growth can be restricted with a Screen of Green (SCROG), with the plants carefully tied to mesh netting. There’s a nice side effect: these plants generally then increase in yield. Growing outdoors is recommended only in Mediterranean or tropical climates. Given the high Haze proportion, plenty of light and heat are crucial for successful growth.These regular seeds produce female and male plants. Whether you select a particular phenotype or want to breed your own crosses – regular cannabis seeds from Sensi Seeds produce tough and stress-resistant plants.Effect, flavour and smell of Mother's Finest Regular Jack Herer is well-known for its powerful high, which takes users straight to stratospheric heights.

By crossing a Skunk #1 with a secret, exceptionally sweet mother plant. Compared to Skunk #1, the calyxes are larger while the pistils are shorter. Plants grown from Sensi Skunk Regular cannabis seeds are characterised by their fast growth and short flowering time. They have average height gain. It’s one of those strain where even novices can’t go wrong. Enjoy a rich yield with little effort – that’s the promise of this cannabis strain!In moderate climates, Sensi Skunk Regular can be grown outdoors. Of course, it also flourishes magnificently under lamps or in a greenhouse. The best results can be achieved with a Sea of Green (SOG).Effect, flavour and smell of Sensi Skunk RegularThe thick buds of this indica-heavy hybrid leave no doubt: Sensi Skunk Regular is potent enough to bring a smile to the face of even hardened weed smokers. The calm yet euphoric high delivers a deeply relaxed effect. Tired muscles make a quick recovery. Very few users report severe hunger attacks - the munchies. European Skunk variants are praised for having a sweeter, less sharp flavour than their North American counterparts. We wanted to build on these attributes; our breeders have successfully captured the sugary citrus scent that makes a refreshing change from ordinary “Skunk Funk”. The result is a sweet, citrus flavour with an earthy and dry undertone.Did you know?Sensi Skunk and its relatives have won three awards at the Copa de la Marihuana. In 2006, this cannabis strain took the top prize. Sensi Skunk Regular is a low-maintenance strain; for an even easier cultivation process, choose Sensi Skunk Feminized or Sensi Skunk Automatic.</description><meta_title>Sensi Skunk Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Sensi Skunk Regular is a modern classic among cannabis strains.

Strong plants and strong effects are the result of crossing our world-famous Skunk #1 with a robust, high yielding Afghan indica. The deeply relaxing effects are enlivened by the sativa element, providing a long-lasting stone that’s strong without being soporific. Growth pattern of Super Skunk RegularSuper Skunk Regular cannabis seeds produce strong, uniform plants. Conical in shape, they grow thick, densely packed branches. Thanks to the strain’s dominant indica genetics, the plants seldom grow beyond average height, which makes them easy to manage for indoor growers. Short vegetation periods ensure that Super Skunk remains compact; yields can be increased by extending the vegetation length instead. This is a Regular strain, which means the seeds will produce both male and female plants. This advantage presents opportunities for creating cross-breeds. It’s also a smart choice for those seeking a robust strain that can withstand environmental fluctuations, and is ideal for new growers attempting their first outdoor crop. Super Skunk is a mix of 80% indica and 20% sativa. It has a short flowering time of around seven weeks. Once flowering commences, the buds develop quickly. Their appearance is pure indica: large, heavy, and coated in trichomes. Expect big yields from this plant! This strain is well suited to indoor cultivation under lights. However, it is possible to grow Super Skunk outdoors in temperate climates. In normal summer conditions, plants will produce excellent harvests of large buds. They’re also ideal for cultivating in greenhouses, though adequate airflow must be provided, particularly in the last couple of weeks of flowering. More experienced growers may like to experiment with techniques like fimming, topping, and lollipopping, as Super Skunk responds well to all of them. Topping and fimming are especially effective at boosting yields - the colas on the new ‘main’ branches will grow considerably larger. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk RegularSuper Skunk produces a noticeably intense scent; especially during the later stages of the flowering period. It’s not quite the same as other members of the skunk family, due to its sweet citrusy aroma, which combines pleasingly with the earthy, spicy base-notes. However, be aware that the smell is strong. Indoor growers may want to use air scrubbers to stop the scent spreading beyond the grow space. Upon consumption, people often notice that the scent is replicated in the taste; citrus-dominant, earthy, and with a hint of sweetness. Some have even compared the flavour to mandarin orange. The effects of Super Skunk are potent, and its relaxing qualities make it suitable for those looking for stress-relief. The balance of indica and sativa results in a high that’s uplifting and pleasant, while remaining calming and tranquil. Did you know?

We bred this for growers who aren’t afraid of powerful effects and pungent odours. Shiva Skunk is an award-winning variety that leaves a lasting impression of relaxation and delight on all who consume it. The plants are compact and sturdy, producing huge buds which, by the end of the short flowering period, are completely covered in resin. For those who love skunk, but wish it was stronger, this is an excellent choice. Growth pattern of Shiva Skunk RegularAlthough it was originally released over thirty years ago, Shiva Skunk remains a favourite among fans of cannabis. New generations of growers discover it every year, delighted by its ease of cultivation and large, chunky buds. Shiva Skunk Regular has the kind of bud structure and potency that only comes with a premium indica-dominant heritage. Being 85% indica ensures plentiful yields in a conveniently short flowering period of 45 to 55 days. Whether grown indoors or outside (in warm or temperate climates), growers can expect excellent harvests, without requiring too much technical know-how or expertise. Later in the flowering stage, the buds will rapidly bulk up. You’ll also notice the trademark layer of large trichomes (inherited from Northern Lights #5). The hybrid vigour means that Shiva Skunk Regular can outperform both of its parents in terms of resin content and yield. Shiva Skunk Regular is a compact strain, and the plants don’t grow to great heights. The lateral branching and squat, ‘pine tree’ shape means that it’s not well suited to lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Shiva Skunk RegularSome refer to Shiva Skunk’s scent as oily or dense, while others claim that it has a creamy quality. Either way, most people agree that the aroma is musky, with sweet citrus undertones. The smell of berry and sandalwood is also detectable. The plants produce a pungent scent - a fact that discreet growers might want to bear in mind. Shiva Skunk Regular produces potent effects, often lifting the mood, and making the user feel more adventurous or thoughtful. Some users say that it’s a smooth, mellow high, which is unsurprising, given that it was bred from two indica-dominant strains. However, the slightly euphoric effects are down to the plant’s sativa relatives. After sampling Shiva Skunk, expect to experience relaxing effects, minus the lethargy. This makes it a popular choice for consuming in the evening, or for those who want a calming effect without feeling tired. Please note, Shiva Skunk is known for producing powerful highs, so inexperienced users should proceed with caution! Did you know?

This result is a gourmet strain that is suitable for discerning and commercial growers alike. The ‘American dream’ is a term first coined by the historian James Truslow Adams. He dreamed of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone. Sensi Seeds has developed this cannabis strain in analogy with the American dream. By selecting from a broad gene pool that has been improved over the decades, our experts have realised the dream of permanent progress.American Dream Regular growth patternThis indica hybrid (75% indica, 25% sativa) is based on an Afghan skunk strain and tropical sativas from Jamaica and Hawaii. In terms of strength, yield and stability, American Dream Regular impresses the most discerning growers. The compact plants grow evenly, with above-average height gain. Please note that these are regular cannabis seeds which produce male and female plants.In the right hands, American Dream Regular produces a plentiful yield. It is characterised by fist-sized buds bursting with pistils and covered by a sticky layer of resin. The structure is typically indica: at the beginning of the flowering stage (7 to 8 weeks), the sativa influence is also apparent in the light-green leaves.These plants perform best indoors under artificial light. Outdoor cultivation will also succeed provided that summers are warm. At best, up to 1 kg can be harvested from a single plant. Advanced cultivation methods such as SOG (Sea of Green) or SCROG (Screen of Green) promise particularly good results.Effect, flavour and smell of American Dream RegularThe first sign of the effect of this cannabis strain is a pleasant lightness that slowly spreads throughout the entire body. Many smokers become happier and more sociable. In comparison with other indica-dominant strains, American Dream Regular does not trigger couch lock. As a result, it is suitable for use during the day as well as in the evenings. The pungent skunk smell is accompanied by a distinctive pine tone. The flavour is rounded off with fresh, fruity notes.Did you know?American Dream smells comparatively strong. Stealth growers who value discretion should select a different strain.

These regular cannabis seeds produce exceptionally strong and uniform plants that flower after just 45 to 50 days.Skunk #1 Regular growth patternThe original skunk hybrids fused traditional landraces from Central and South America, Afghanistan and Thailand. Through several generations of intensive selection and countless backcrossing, our genetics experts successfully managed to stabilise the very best examples of skunk. The result: the world’s first natural sativa-indica hybrid – Skunk #1 (35% sativa, 65% indica).The growth and flowering reflect the typically indica characteristics. During the flowering stage, Skunk #1 does not grow much taller than a pure indica strain. The wonderful leaves originate from its Afghan predecessors. They turn darker as the plant ages – from a fresh lime green to a deep dark green.The consistent performance and rich harvest demonstrate the true significance of hybrid power. Robust stems and branches form fast to support the heavy buds. Flowering starts very quickly, and is relatively short at 45 to 50 days. The sativa heritage is evident in the plentiful long stems as much as in the calyxes. The same is true of the explosive reach of the resinous buds shortly before harvest time. Beholding the colourful goings-on brings true delight.Skunk #1 Regular flourishes outdoors in moderate climates with long summers. These seeds also perform well indoors under lamps. Because regular cannabis seeds produce exceptionally strong plants, Skunk #1 Regular is the perfect candidate for advanced trim and cultivation techniques such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Lollipopping and Supercropping.

The key facts: 35% sativa, 65% indica.California Indica is sold as the successor to the Orange Bud, which has its origins on the west coast of California. Since different lines of seeds were propagated over a large area, there are various phenotypes, ranging from sativas to almost pure indicas. California Indica Regular growth patternSensi Seeds California Indica is bred from a heavy, high-yield Orange Bud mother whose traits lean more towards sativa. However, it also has another parent plant. An Afghan hash plant has played a major role in the development of this hybrid, explaining the above-average yields and robust, compact nature. The genes comprise 35% sativa and 65% indica.California Indica Regular cannabis seeds are suitable for indoor cultivation, but they can also be grown outside in the open air without much additional plant care being required. Perfectly suited to the continental climate, the plants won’t be bothered by the occasional aberration or storm.The flowering stage is relatively short at an average of 45 to 50 days, while the height gain remains nicely manageable. Although these are strong cannabis plants, pests and mould still need monitoring. The lush, fat buds need to be protected against excessive moisture and require good ventilation. These cannabis strains are suitable for advanced cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Supercropping and Lollipopping.Effect, flavour and smell of California Indica RegularThe effect of our California Indica is best described as a sun-drenched, uplifting high with an element of relaxation from a deep body buzz.

As the name suggests, the strain is a hybrid of Hindu Kush (with its pure Afghani genes), and Skunk #1. The combination produces plants that are vigorous and high-yielding, with a scent and taste that’s distinctly skunk-like. It’s a regular variant of the strain, which means the seeds produce both male and female plants. This is an advantage to more advanced growers, who might be looking to create their own hybrids. It’s also useful for those who want to generate their own seeds. However, initial yields may be slightly limited by the presence of male plants.As a regular strain, Skunk Kush Regular needs a temperate or continental climate to achieve its full potential. The strain has a short flowering time of around 50 to 60 days (both inside and out), with the buds being ready to harvest at the end of September / start of October when grown outdoors. The flower formation is impressive, and can only be described as ‘towering’.Skunk Kush Regular isn’t one of the tallest strains on the market. The plants grow to a moderate height (usually a maximum of 150 cm, regardless of whether they’re grown indoors or outside). This is useful to those using grow tents or any location with height restrictions. Skunk Kush Regular takes on a ‘candelabra’ shape while growing. The slight indica-dominance means that the leaves are typically dark green and leathery, and the branches are robust and strong. It offers an exceptionally generous yield too, and the buds are usually covered in frosty trichomes. The Afghani heritage is immediately apparent when the buds start to develop; with bubbling calyxes making for dense, semi-open buds with plenty of weight to them. They have a large surface area, which ensures plenty of resin production. Some of the trichomes develop heads that are so bulbous, you can actually see them swell and change colour in their later stages of growth. When the plants are left to grow by themselves, the central bud takes up around half the main stem; or as much as 75% on the more open female plants. Skunk Kush Regular thrives in a warmer, Mediterranean climates. Under these sunny, temperate conditions, it’s capable of producing incredibly large yields, without succumbing to mould. Lollipopping and supercropping are both techniques that generate good results with this strain. Effect, taste, and smell of Skunk Kush RegularSkunk Kush Regular is slightly indica-dominant. This is evident in the resulting high; a full-bodied, intense stone, which is both cerebral and deeply physical. The sativa influence sometimes induces a state of uncontrollable giggles, while the indica provides a sensation of powerful relaxation. Be warned, this isn’t a strain for those who aren’t used to consuming cannabis, as it’s quite potent. While they’re growing, the plants produce a musky skunk scent. The dark, resinous Afghani smell is enhanced with a fresh citrus punch. When nearing the harvest stages, the fruity aroma gets stronger, with scents of lemon and menthol coming to the foreground. These flavours can also be picked up on tasting it; making for a refreshing, invigorating experience.

Two individuals with the optimal combination of sativa and indica qualities were first produced successfully in 1995. The final F1 hybrid is based on premium genetics from Thailand and Afghanistan. Fruity Juice Regular produces incredible yields. Experienced enthusiasts with the right equipment harvest up to 500 g/m². The plants grow vigorously during the flowering stage. If the plant is restricted, the growth phase should be kept correspondingly short. Simple mesh netting, better known as Screen of Green (SCROG), subsequently helps. The sky’s the limit in a sunny greenhouse or in the fresh air. The elegant plants then bend under the weight of the candied buds, a feature that makes this landrace from Thailand so famous.

Growers have prized it for decades, due to its calming high and affordability. The plants are conveniently compact, which makes them ideal for people with limited space. Shiva Shanti II also produces bumper yields, without the usual effort involved. The scent is reminiscent of lavender and fresh soil, and an equally pleasant taste. Growth pattern of Shiva Shanti II Regular Shiva Shanti II Regular cannabis seeds are 75% indica, 25% sativa. The strain was originally developed by Sensi Seeds in the nineties, with the aim of being both affordable and versatile. The genetics comprise Garlic and Kush genetics, mixed with an Afghani variant. This ensures that the plants produce good yields and are easy to grow. This is the regular variety of the strain, which means that the seeds will produce both male and female plants. The presence of male plants is useful for those that want to produce their own seeds for future cultivation, or who want to have a go at creating their own hybrids. Shiva Shanti II Regular has the advantage of having a short flowering time, of just 45 to 55 days. This, combined with the fact that it’s a low-maintenance strain, means that growers can enjoy quick results without too much effort. It’s popular with those who don’t have much space to grow in, as plants tend to reach just 100 to 160 cm indoors. Outside, they may grow slightly taller, but are usually limited to 150 to 180 cm, which means they can comfortably fit inside an average greenhouse. As such, they’re a good choice for growers looking to cultivate the plants discreetly.Structurally, Shiva Shanti II Regular is squat and sturdy-looking, with a solid central stem. This swiftly becomes laden with buds towards harvest-time. The buds themselves are large, weighty and coated in resin. Growers usually generate excellent harvests from their plants; about 400 to 450 grams per square metre when cultivated inside, and 600 to 800 grams per plant outdoors. In fact, some growers have even reported getting as much as one kilo from a single plant. The strain does well in warmer climates, though it can thrive in more temperate regions too. It’s possible to cultivate it indoors all year round. As for training techniques – growers report good success with both lollipopping and supercropping. Effect, taste, and smell of Shiva Shanti II Regular Shiva Shanti II Regular is 75% indica, and the resulting high is mostly indica in personality. Users claim that it relaxes the muscles, and creates a sense of calm and serenity. However, thanks to the 25% sativa, it also provides a mild hit of energy, which makes it more uplifting than the average indica stone. It’s not as potent as some other strains, and as such, is a solid option for relaxing in the evening. The plants have a classic skunk aroma while growing, with the muskiness of the Garlic parent plant. As the buds become ready to harvest, they take on the scent of lavender too, which is evident in the taste. Did you know? Shiva Shanti II was named after Sensi Seeds founder Ben Dronkers’ twin daughters. It also is linked to the Hindu god, Shiva, who is often linked with cannabis. Some of the strain’s phenotypes can produce a strong scent of garlic.Shiva Shanti II Regular was developed to be easier to grow than the original Shiva Shanti strain.It’s largely mould and pest-resistant, which makes it even simpler to cultivate.</description><meta_title>Shiva Shanti II Regular Seeds– Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Shiva Shanti II Regular is 75% indica, 25% sativa.

One of our customers eventually brought only the best seeds to the Netherlands, where our breeders immediately got to work. The idea was to take various Sensi Seeds parent plants to enhance the originally pure Indian genetics. The aim: greater resilience, greater strength, greater yield - and all faster than before. It’s pretty logical that we used a skunk here; but Guerrilla's Gusto Regular also incudes other, potentially surprising elements. Guerrilla's Gusto Regular growth patternThe result is a master of survival, with more power than the low price might suggest. The growth pattern may surprise certain growers too. Despite 90% indica genes, Guerrilla's Gusto Regular demonstrates above-average growth. We have even seen plants reach in excess of 300 cm. One of our favourite examples was grown in the middle of London, actually! Guerrilla gardeners and novices seeking a super-strong outdoor strain can rely on Guerrilla's Gusto Regular. It can of course also be grown indoors under lamps. Good soil, regular water, sufficient light – that’s all it needs! This high-yield strain can deliver lush harvests even without much care and attention. It takes 50 to 65 days before it’s ready to harvest. Please note that this is a regular strain which produces male and female plants. Anyone a bit more familiar with cannabis cultivation can breed mother plants and raise clones. A Screen of Green (SCROG) can be used to control tall-growing plants.Effect, flavour and smell of Guerrilla's Gusto Regular“Ay Caramba!”, the effect of Guerrilla's Gusto has it all! The sticky indica buds deliver a typical old-school indica trip. Which means: a physical, even high.Just as classical is the aromatic bouquet. With earthy and sweet notes at the same time, this cannabis impresses fans of authentic retro flavours. Did you know?“Guerrilla Grower” is the name given to someone who grows cannabis outdoors in secret locations. Many growers use this method because they consider growing it at home to be too risky.</description><meta_title>Guerrilla's Gusto Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Guerrilla's Gusto Regular seeds produce 90% indica plants that grow almost everywhere outdoors.

Homogeneous plants with minimal differences make cannabis cultivation child’s play. These regular seeds produce compact plants with average height gain and an incredibly short flowering time. Seven to eight weeks is a record!The influence of Afghan strains is evident in the dark, broad-bladed fan leaves and the short internode gaps. But the Early Girl Regular also includes north Indian races and a Mexican sativa of the highest order. You can rightly assume that this girl is a fighter! Cold, temperature fluctuations and rain can’t touch it. Early Girl Regular is the perfect partner for anything living in a cold climate. Conceived as an outdoor strain, it cuts a fine figure on a balcony or in a garden, whatever the weather. A spot in the sunshine, water, some fertiliser – that’s all it needs.

This means users can expect a classic sativa high; happy, light and cerebral. As such, it’s a great option for using during the day. Early Pearl grows to impressively towering heights and produces formidable harvests. When looked after well, outdoor plants can generate as much as 2 kilos each! Growers can enjoy the distinctive aroma too; fresh notes of sweet citrus and pine, combined with incense and wood. Growth pattern of Early Pearl RegularEarly Pearl Regular cannabis seeds are 75% sativa and 25% indica. It’s the first sativa-dominant strain to be developed specifically to thrive in shorter summers, and in cooler climates. The indica genetics add robustness and ease-of-maintenance (while boosting the yield), but the high is pure sativa; vibrant, uplifting and energising. The seeds are regular, which means that they’ll produce female and male plants. Regular seeds are a good option for those wanting to generate their own seeds for further growing, or who want to experiment with cross-breeding with other strains. It has a relatively short flowering time of 50 to 70 days. To maximise the harvest, growers recommend planting the seeds inside as winter comes to an end, then moving them outside to a sunny spot after spring equinox. When grown outdoors, it’s sensible to anticipate impressive heights. In fact, it’s not uncommon for the plants to reach around 200 to 400 cm! Indoors, the growth is restricted to around 100 to 190 cm. Like many sativa-dominant varieties, Early Pearl Regular is tall and elegant, with extended branches and dark leaves. The buds tend to be densely packed, large, and if the weather is cooler, may take on a purple colour. Towards harvest-time, they’ll also develop a generous coating of white, shining resin. One of the reasons Early Pearl Regular remains popular with growers is its extensive harvests. When cultivated inside, it’s not uncommon to generate about 500 grams per square metre. However, outdoors is where the yields really come into their own. In the right conditions, growers can obtain up to 2 kilograms per plant. It’s a tough, resilient strain, and as a result, does well in cooler climates with shorter summers. However, the plants do require plenty of sunlight in order to reach their full potential. Experienced growers report good success with the lollipopping and supercropping techniques. Effect, taste, and smell of Early Pearl RegularEarly Pearl Regular is 75% sativa and 25% indica, and the high reflects this sativa-dominance perfectly. Users report a fast-acting, energetic effect, which leaves them feeling happy and uplifted. The high is also fairly long-lasting, making the strain an appealing option for daytime use. The plants produce a fresh, zesty scent while growing, with notes of orange and pine. As the buds reach full maturity, the smell grows in strength, and takes on a hint of chopped wood and incense. The citrus and pine can both be detected in the taste. Did you know? It’s a good strain for cross-breeding, and adds stability and strength to future hybrids. Early Pearl Regular was first introduced back in the 1980s, and has been a favourite outdoor variety since then. This is a viable option for beginners, as the plants don’t require too much maintenance or expertise.</description><meta_title>Early Pearl Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Early Pearl Regular is 75% sativa, 25% indica.

Each pack features a random mix of Guerilla’s Gusto, Ruderalis Indica, Early Girl, Early Skunk, and Ruderalis Skunk. They’ll produce regular plants, which is useful for future grows, or experimental cross-breeding. Although the plants are different strains, all of them offer a typical indica scent; skunky and pungent. The high is classic indica too; calming and sedative. Growth pattern of Outdoor Mix RegularOutdoor Mix Regular cannabis seeds are a random mix of five different indica-dominant varieties. These are: Early Skunk, Early Girl, Ruderalis Indica, Ruderalis Skunk, and Guerrilla’s Gusto. The subtle variations between the strains gives first-time growers the opportunity to learn how to identify them.The seeds are all regular, which means they’ll produce a mix of male and female plants. This is appealing for the more experienced grower, who may want to experiment with cross-breeding the strains in the future. It also means that seeds can be generated for future grows. As this pack features five different strains, the flowering times vary slightly from plant to plant. However, as they’re all indica, the flowering periods are relatively short. This is useful for those who want to get results in a hurry. The first plants to start producing buds will be the naturally autoflowering varieties; Ruderalis Indica first, followed by Ruderalis Skunk. Then the other strains will start to flower. Early Girl is ready for harvest fairly speedily, closely followed by Guerrilla’s Gusto. The last to harvest is Early Skunk. Outdoor Mix Regular’s plants all grow to different heights. Usually, they’re more compact when grown indoors under artificial light, and none of the plants tend to reach excessive heights when planted outside. They’re all quite diverse in appearance, but share some of the same indica characteristics; such as multiple branches and an overall look of bushiness and sturdiness. Yields tend to be good with these strains too, though the autoflowering varieties may produce less than the other plants. Growers often appreciate Outdoor Mix Regular’s ability to thrive in cooler climates, as all the strains are tough and resilient, even in cold weather. Lollipopping and supercropping are both effective training techniques for this mix. Effect, taste, and smell of Outdoor Mix RegularAll the plants grown from Outdoor Mix Regular are indica-dominant. This means that their high is typically indica in personality; a deep, relaxing body-stone that’s often long-lasting. The autoflowering varieties offer a less potent high, which some users claim makes them a solid option for daily use.The scent of the plants is also typical of indica. There’s a distinct note of skunk, combined with an overall aroma of earthiness, and a hint of sweetness and spice. The smell often becomes more noticeable as the plants reach harvest-time, and the flavours carry through to the taste too. Did you know? Outdoor Mix Regular is a random mix of five different varieties, and there’s no way of telling which seed will grow into which strain. This makes it a good choice for those who want to practice their identification skills.All five varieties have been developed to thrive, even in cooler temperatures. The strains have been carefully selected to complement one another.All the seeds in Outdoor Mix Regular can be grown together.The mix will last an entire outdoor season.

With a relatively high amount of CBD and little THC, it’s of interest in particular to consumers wanting to enjoy the effect of the cannabinoids without being overwhelmed by a strong high. Ruderalis Indica Regular growth pattern Ruderalis Indica embodies the unique properties of Cannabis Ruderalis, which grows in Eastern Europe. By crossing it with classical indica strains, the Sensi Seeds breeders have given it some added pep. The result is a fast-growing, compact and practical hardy beauty that flourishes magnificently anywhere.What many people do not know: Ruderalis Indica Regular seeds are semi-autoflowering, which means that half of the plants begin to flower independently with no adjustment to the lighting period. Even today, behind every autoflowering strain is a Ruderalis plant. Ruderalis Indica has a short flowering time (40 to 50 days), with adult plants growing from seedlings within 10 to 12 weeks. Cold or rainy summers can’t touch this fighter. It is suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.Advanced cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Supercropping and Lollipopping are unnecessary with this strain. Yields are moderate.Effect, flavour and smell of Ruderalis Indica RegularRuderalis Indica Regular is not the right strain for powerful intoxication. With little THC and a relatively high amount of CBD, it is a functional cannabis strain that can be enjoyed at any time of the day. The cannabinoid profile makes Ruderalis Indica Regular an interesting medicinal strain. Don’t expect any great highs with respect to taste and smell. The dried buds of Ruderalis Indica Regular generally smell and taste rather neutral. Some buds contain relatively high amounts of myrcene and caryophyllales, which can result in a flowery flavour. Did you know?The main difference between Cannabis ruderalis and Cannabis sativa as well as Cannabis indica is that Ruderalis plants begin to flower automatically. It’s still not certain whether ruderalis is a type in itself, or simply a variety of sativa.</description><meta_title>Ruderalis Indica Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Ruderalis Indica Regular is a semi-autoflowering strain with more CBD than THC.

This 90% sativa reliably delivers harvests under almost any conditions, indoors and out – even during cold, wet summers! Beginners and experts alike will benefit from Durban's powerful and generous nature. Growth pattern of Durban RegularSensi Seeds’ Durban Regular cannabis seeds are known as one of the purest sativas. When it comes to looks, you can expect to see a plant that’s more squat and solid-looking than the usual tall, lean sativas found in warmer climates. This has no effect on the high, however!This strain is capable of delivering plentiful quantities of sticky buds, even if the summer is damp and cold. It’s favoured by hobbyists and breeders alike, thanks to its predictable growth and steady yields.Durban Regular is a resilient strain, and can be cultivated in virtually any area. If you want a sativa with impressive yields that can flower successfully even in chilly, wet climates with short summers, this is the strain for you. The plants are also likely to recover from most errors made during growing. The same applies for withstanding particularly bad weather, if grown outdoors. Indoor growers will also appreciate the tenacity of the cannabis plants – it comes in especially handy when experimenting with growroom set-ups, or growing a close-to-pure sativa strain for the very first time. Durban Regular’s flowering time can be as short as 50 days, with a maximum of ten weeks. This is surprisingly quick for a strain that’s 90% sativa. The staggering heights, however, are exactly what you’d expect. Anticipate speedy growth from the start of flowering right through to harvest. In some cases, plants may even triple in height. When cultivated outdoors in free soil (rather than pots), during a warm summer, Durban can reach around two metres. The main growth pattern is typically sativa, though you can expect some lateral branching. Durban is an elegant plant; slender and tall, with long buds that spiral around the branches. There’s plenty of room for experimentation with this strain too; for example, with supercropping or training. Regardless of how they’re grown, Durban Regular’s yields tend to be generous. This is the case even when the plants are left to their own devices. Effect, taste, and smell of Durban RegularThe immediacy of the high can unsettle those who aren’t used to it; Durban is not a “creeper”, so if vaporised or smoked it will grant almost instant effects. It produces an ethereal high, without making the user feel lethargic. As the plants grow, they produce a subtle, almost herbal scent. Once flowering takes place, you’ll notice more of a bite to the smell, thanks to the citrusy notes. These aromas intensify after harvesting and curing, and the taste is reminiscent of aniseed and pine.

It combines the strength and resiliance of a classic ruderalis, with the potency of Skunk #1. The plants are compact enough to be grown in even small indoor spaces, and can be grown outdoors in most climates, making them really easy to cultivate. Users claim that the high is relaxing and sedative, and the scent pleasantly skunky; earthy and sweet, with a touch of coffee and liquorice. Growth pattern of Ruderalis Skunk RegularRuderalis Skunk Regular cannabis seeds are 90% indica and 10% sativa. The strain was developed to offer the hardiness of a classic ruderalis, and the fast-flowering capabilities and potent high of Skunk #1. This results in a plant that’s easy to grow, capable of flourishing in most climates, and higher in THC than most ruderalis varieties. This is a regular variant, which means that the seeds produce both female and male plants. With the regular option, growers can generate their own supply of seeds for further grows, or use the seeds to cross-breed with other plants. Be aware that roughly 50% of the seeds will result in autoflowering plants, and the others will be dependent on photoperiods. The flowering time of Ruderalis Skunk Regular is incredibly short – approximately 40 to 50 days to be exact. This is appealing to those that want to enjoy a quick harvest, or who want to achieve multiple yields throughout the year. The height of the plants is also usually short, both indoors and outdoors. It varies from 60 cm to 120 cm at the most, though some of the autoflowering plants can reach as high as 200 cm. Like many indica-dominant strains, although Ruderalis Skunk Regular isn’t very tall, it’s quite bushy. The plants are covered in plenty of leaves and branches, with short gaps between the internodes. As for the buds? They’re large, weighty and covered in sticky resin. The yields are fairly impressive for a low-maintenance strain; growers report collecting around 300 grams per square metre when cultivating the plants indoors. They grow well in the home, but are equally comfortable outdoors, even in cooler climates. It’s a strong, robust variety, and as an added bonus, is also largely resistant to pests and mould. Effect, taste, and smell of Ruderalis Skunk RegularRuderalis Skunk Regular is strongly indica-dominant. Although its genetics include many ruderalis specimens (which are typically low in THC), it’s capable of producing a much more powerful stone than the average ruderalis plant. Users appreciate the long-lasting nature of the high, along with the sense of relaxation and calm. Although it’s fairly potent, it’s not overpowering, so is suitable for daily use. The aroma of the plants is quite skunky in personality; earthy and rich, with notes of coffee beans and sweet liquorice. These subtle scents intensify as the buds near harvest-time, and can also be detected in the taste. Did you know? Ruderalis Skunk Regular is one of the world’s first autoflowering varieties (approximately half the seeds will autoflower).It’s widely regarded as one of the easiest-to-grow strains available.Ruderalis Skunk Regular’s photoperiod-sensitive plants (about half of them) can be triggered to flower at the same time as other popular strains, like Early Skunk. That means that growers can benefit from a double-harvest. The plants that are sensitive to photoperiods are usually taller, and typically produce bigger yields too. Ruderalis Skunk Regular is naturally resistant to infestations and fungus, which makes it even simpler to cultivate.</description><meta_title>Ruderalis Skunk Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Ruderalis Skunk Regular is 90% indica/10% sativa.

The answer is Jamaican Pearl Regular cannabis seeds. This resistant, early-flowering strain can be grown outdoors in most climates. Thanks to 85% sativa genes, it delivers a mood-lifting high.Jamaica is home to a number of tropical sativas that have been planted and perfected over many years. So it’s all the more surprising that modern cannabis cultivation includes only a few Caribbean strains. Our Marley’s Collie has countless fans, so we really wanted to bring a new strain to the market.It’s bred for easy growth, suitable for the European climate, yet boasts that irresistible tropical flavour. It certainly wasn’t an easy undertaking, but when you think that nowadays, Jamaican Pearl is one of our most popular outdoor strains, we can proudly say that we have achieved our goal. Starting with Marley’s Collie, we found the perfect pollen donor in our Early Pearl. It produces fast-flowering and tough offspring, and as a tropical sativa male, it dilutes neither the tropical flavour nor the cerebral, energetic high. Jamaican Pearl Regular growth patternOur tests generate uniform, strong plants with fast growing behaviour and the desired combination of taste, effect and weight. Jamaican Pearl cannabis seeds produce tall plants that can reach up to 300 cm outside. The flowering phase lasts between 50 and 75 days, producing plentiful large, shaggy buds.This strain of course also thrives indoors under artificial light. The ceiling of the growing room must be high enough, however. A Screen of Green (SCROG) may also help. Good results can also be achieved with special pruning methods such as Supercropping and Lollipopping.Effect, flavour and smell of Jamaican Pearl RegularWith 85% sativa genes, Jamaican Pearl Regular delivers just the high you’d expect: mood-lifting, positive and energetic but not as hard-hitting as certain THC-rich Haze strains. The effect is felt primarily in the head, but is always manageable and won’t stop you getting on with other things. You can enjoy this cannabis strain morning, noon and night.We were very keen to capture the tropical flavour of Jamaican sativa. The best Jamaican Pearl Regular phenotypes smell sweet, fruity and earthy all at once – a little like a mild summer’s evening in the Caribbean. To fully savour the flavour notes, consume this weed in a vaporiser.Did you know?Jamaican Pearl is one of our award-winning cannabis strains. At the Highlife Festival, it took 1st prize in two categories. But if you prefer something easier to grow, you can also order this strain as Jamaican Pearl Feminized.</description><meta_title>Jamaican Pearl Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Jamaican Pearl Regular produces tall sativa plants that thrive outside even in cool climates.

The tall, elegant plants produce weed with an aroma that differs from typical Haze strains.Mexican Sativa Regular growth patternSo how did we succeed in getting this exotic cannabis strain acclimatised to northern climates? By crossing an original, little-known strain from Oaxaca with the robust African sativa strain Durban. To shorten the flowering time and further improve resistance to cold, we also added a Hash Plant from Pakistan. The result is a plant based on 70% sativa genes, with elegant, elongated buds. The loose structure of the buds means they’re very resistant to mould. Those who know it praise the versatility of this strain. It can be cultivated in a growing room as easily as it can outdoors. But remember: these plants can grow vigorously during the flowering phase, which can last up to ten weeks. In moderate or warm climates, plants regularly reach a height of two metres. Indoors, you can manage growth by keeping the vegetation period a little shorter. Thinning out the plants also helps, resulting in bushier growth. The side branches of the Mexican Sativa respond well to this method.Other cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Lollipopping or Supercropping are also suitable for this cannabis strain, and will further increase already good yields. Effect, flavour and smell of Mexican Sativa RegularThe powerful, energetic high is perfect for physical activities. The majority of smokers report feelings of euphoria accompanied by (uncontrollable) giggling fits. New cannabis users should proceed with caution. Because Mexican Sativa is not a pure sativa, it also has a relaxing component. It has a long-lasting effect. The flavours of Mexican Sativa are an unusual blend of sandalwood, flowery notes and pine. The scent during the growth and flowering phase is subtle, which is an advantage for certain growers. When smoked, notes of liquorice and citrus come to the fore, with underlying woody and earthy flavours. If you want a change from the usual Haze flavours, this could be the perfect strain for you!Did you know?“Sativa, sweet sativa, cannabis sativa, grown by nature down in Mexico,…” The heavy metal fans among you may recognise these lyrics. The hard guitar riffs by Anvil are a matter of taste, but the song “Sativa” goes well with the energy boost this strain triggers.In addition to these regular seeds, this cannabis strain is also available as Mexican Sativa Feminized.</description><meta_title>Mexican Sativa Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Mexican Sativa Regular differs from other sativa strains: despite 70% sativa genes, it is affordable, easy to grow and resistant to cold.</meta_description><url><![CDATA[https://sensiseeds.com/en/cannabis-seeds/sensi-seeds/mexican-sativa]]></url><image><![CDATA[https://img.sensiseeds.com/en/cannabis-seeds/sensi-seeds/mexican-sativa-thumb.png]]></image><price>24.01</price><currency>eur</currency><in_stock>Yes</in_stock><category>Outdoor</category><flowering_min>50</flowering_min><flowering_max>70</flowering_max><strain_type>Regular</strain_type><number_of_seeds>10</number_of_seeds><climate_zone>Cool /Cold</climate_zone><yield>Medium Yield</yield><heigh_gain>High plant</heigh_gain></item><item><itemtype>Product</itemtype><id>1500039</id><title>Early Skunk Regular Seeds</title><description>Early Skunk is an original Sensi Seeds strain, bred from the award-winning Skunk #1 and outdoor favourite Early Pearl.

Growers can expect to see resin-coated flowers, and sizeable yields. Early Skunk requires a level of know-how when cultivating. Experienced growers can achieve good results with supercropping and training, as long as they start early in the vegetation process. The plants grow well outdoors, in either large pots or free soil. Thanks to its 35% sativa content, Early Skunk can grow to impressive heights by the time its flowering period is over. This generally happens at around seven to nine weeks; it’s not uncommon for plants to triple in size, especially during the last few weeks. The generous size of the plants, combined with the expansive branches, results in a large harvest. It’s easy for the top colas to reach over 30 cm. Expect the buds to be large and dense too.While other strains with similar buds have issues with rot and mould, Early Skunk is highly resilient, even in cold, wet climates. This is due to the hybridisation of Skunk #1 with Early Pearl, resulting in a robust, mould-resistant end-product. This makes it an excellent choice for growers who want to cultivate their cannabis plants in colder, damper climates. Effect, taste, and smell of Early Skunk RegularEarly Skunk cannabis buds are also valued for their flavour, and the effects they produce when consumed. Smokers usually report a calm, contented high, which inspires more creative thought. Early Skunk Regular provides strong effects which, given a good hot summer, can be comparable to indoor grown cannabis. Early Skunk has an earthy, spicy smell, with a lot of depth to it, typical for a cannabis plant with a high indica content. Some say that the top-note is reminiscent of diesel, demonstrating that the terpenes in cannabis often combine to create a range of unusual aromas. This blend of earth and diesel is most pronounced during the flowering period, and just after harvesting. Once the buds are cured, the scent shifts, becoming brighter and more floral. Did you know?

This results in a plant that produces extremely large harvests, with a fairly rapid flowering time. The height of this strain can be kept compact indoors, but can reach 300 cm when unleashed outdoors. The scent is of a pure sativa; pineapple-tinged, spicy and sweet. Expect a high that’s both calming and uplifting, with a sense of euphoria. Growth pattern of Ed Rosenthal Super Bud RegularEd Rosenthal Super Bud Regular cannabis combines genetics from around the world; Africa, Central America and South East Asia, to name a few; and some of the sativa parentage is top secret. This is a regular variety. That means that the seeds will produce both female and male plants, which is useful for those who want to generate their own batch of seeds for future grows. The regular strain is also the right choice for growers wanting to experiment with cross-breeding with other varieties. Ed Rosenthal Super Bud Regular has a relatively swift flowering time of 55 to 65 days. When grown inside, the plants are usually compact, and reach around 80 to 160 cm in height on average. Outdoors, they’re likely to grow much taller; to heights of around 250 to 300 cm. As the strain is a 50/50 split of indica and sativa, appearances can vary from plant to plant. Some are more sativa in nature, with multiple stems and large, spiralling calyxes. Others look more ‘indica’, with thick central stems and fuzzy hairs on the ends of the buds. Either way, they’re capable of producing formidable yields. When cultivated inside, it’s not uncommon for growers to generate around 500 to 600 grams per square metre. Outside, some plants have been known to produce as much as 1 kilo each. Ed Rosenthal Super Bud Regular thrives best in Mediterranean climates, with plenty of exposure to warmth and sun. Alternatively, the plants can be grown indoors all year around, in any location around the world. The strain responds well to both lollipopping and supercropping. Effect, taste, and smell of Ed Rosenthal Super Bud Regular Ed Rosenthal Super Bud Regular is 50% sativa, 50% indica. This balance is reflected in the high, which offers the classically indica ‘body-stone’, combined with the uplifting, happy qualities of a sativa. Users often praise the unique blend of relaxation and mental alertness that this strain provides. The plants have an exotic aroma; a mix of earthiness and fruitiness that reveals its sativa / indica heritage. The overall scent is reminiscent of pineapple, with other notes of citrus coming through; and this strengthens as the buds reach harvest time. The sweet note of pineapple is also evident in the taste.Did you know? Ed Rosenthal Super Bud Regular won the Tenerife Cannabis Cup (Outdoor category).It was named after Ed Rosenthal, a leading authority figure / activist in the cannabis industry.Its genetics feature a mix of two sativa plants – their identity remains a secret. When planted outdoors, Ed Rosenthal Super Bud Regular is usually harvested around late September / early October.</description><meta_title>Ed Rosenthal Super Bud Regular Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Ed Rosenthal Super Bud is 50% sativa, 50% indica.

This strain goes hand-in-hand with a vaporizer.Eagle Bill® Regular growth patternSensi Seeds has spared no effort and cost in developing this cannabis strain. It combines top genetics from Thailand, Jamaica and Colombia with the sativa inheritance of a pure resin strain. The result: a strong, resinous hybrid strain with 70% sativa.This is reflected in the growth pattern of these regular cannabis seeds, which produce both male and female plants. Following germination, they waste no time in quickly gaining height. The wide internode gaps and spiral shape of the buds are evident even from the start of the flowering time. The buds subsequently become more compact and robust – only now is the indica influence apparent. The flowering time is average at 60 to 70 days. Eagle Bill Amato was an unbelievably relaxed guy who didn’t understand the meaning of rushing anything. Accordingly, this cannabis strain also requires patience. The unique flavour develops only when the plants have finished flowering. But it is all the more prevalent as a result. The vegetation period can be kept short, which makes sense in smaller growing spaces with little ceiling height in particular. Supercropping is also appropriate in this respect. Experienced growers report larger harvests if the plants are cultivated in a Sea of Green (SOG) or Screen of Green (SCROG). What many people do not know: These cultivation methods also work outside in the open air – given sufficient sunshine and a long summer.

Unfortunately, he never got to try his own strain. The intensive pine flavour of Eagle Bill® is best experienced in a vaporizer. It is intensive, without being overpowering.The effect is typically sativa. Perfect as a creative strain during the day, Eagle Bill® delivers a stimulating, cerebral high that triggers real bursts of energy in some people.

Long before vaping became trendy, he drew attention to the benefits of vaping at the Cannabis College in Amsterdam. There are videos doing the rounds on the internet showing Bill and his home-made vaporizer. With great patience, he explains to viewers how the device works.

The compact plants offer high yield potential - another reason why White Widow is a mainstay of the Dutch coffee shop industry.White Widow Regular by White Label growth patternOnly a few other cannabis strains measure up against White Widow. As a potent, easy-to-grow hybrid (65% indica, 35% sativa), this cannabis strain has taken the word by storm.

White Widow and Amsterdam go together like a lid on a saucepan.Based on genetics dating back thousands of years, White Widow Regular by White Label is delightfully easy to look after, and resistant to temperature fluctuations. Even newcomers growing cannabis for the first time can’t go wrong with these seeds. They grow into medium-sized plants that stand out visually wherever they are cultivated. Why is that? It’s because of the many white glands (trichomes) that protect the buds, and lend the plants an almost mystical aura. They are a joy to behold, and are packed with potential healing properties in the form of cannabinoids. Growers who sow the seeds early enough, and live in a warm climate, can grow White Widow Regular by White Label outdoors. Even better results can generally be achieved inside under artificial light. It takes around two months from flowering through to harvesting. It’s worth giving the plants enough time as this is the only way to allow the exceptional trichome production to be pushed to the maximum. Its compact structure makes this cannabis strain a perfect candidate for a SOG (Sea of Green), where many small plants sit closely next to each other. The rich yields can thus be even further increased. Half a kilo per square metre is absolutely possible! XXL yields are thus one of the main reasons why certain growers keep returning to White Widow Regular by White Label. Effect, flavour and smell of White Widow Regular by White LabelMost importantly, good weed should give users a hit!

They find themselves being constantly compared. The bar is set high if they want to achieve something for themselves. So it’s all the more impressive to see how commandingly White Gold Regular by White Label is moving through the cannabis world. The daughter of White Widow and Himalayan Gold is as popular with commercial growers as it is with users. Why is that? On the one hand it’s because of its accessibility and ease of cultivation – it’s certainly no prima donna. On the other hand, it reliably produces a large number of buds enclosed in a syrupy robe of resin. The white trichomes, together with the deep-green colour of the leaves and buds (that can appear purple in cooler temperatures), form a real feast for the eyes. The buds are long and furry with orange-coloured pistils. These plants are medium-high hybrids comprising 60% indica and 40% sativa. The flowering stage is comparatively short at 50 to 65 days. An indoor plant can easily yield half a kilo. In a warm climate with long summers, growers can also try their luck outdoors. An SOG (Sea of Green) or SCROG (Screen of Green) delivers particularly good results. Both these techniques work well both in indoor and outdoor cultivation. Many growers also optimise their crops with Topping, Suppercropping and Lollipopping.

This comes through in the high, which is intensely relaxing, both for the body and mind. The plants’ height can be limited indoors (good for those without much space). Outside, they can reach heights of 200 cm. This hardy strain can cope in even colder climates, and is resistant to mold. The smell is immediately recognisable; a deep, pungent skunk aroma that creates a welcome sense of nostalgia. Growth pattern of Holland’s Hope RegularHolland’s Hope Regular by White Label cannabis seeds are 90% indica and 10% sativa. The strain is one of the first in the world to be developed specifically to thrive in colder conditions. This explains the name, as The Netherlands’ climate is typically far cooler than other locations around the globe. This is the regular version of the strain, which means that the seeds will produce both male and female plants. The advantage of this is that growers will be able to generate their own collection of seeds, which can either be used for future grows, or for cross-breeding with other varieties. Holland’s Hope Regular has a fairly swift flowering period of 50 to 60 days; which is beneficial for those that want to obtain a harvest quickly. As with many indica-dominant strains, the plants are usually short, particularly when cultivated inside. Indoors, they reach heights of around 90 to 150 cm, and outside, their height tends to be 200 cm at the most.The plants are also very indica in appearance too, with plenty of bushy leaves, lots of branches, and an overall look of sturdiness. The buds are dense and heavy, and in some instances, can reach lengths of 50 cm. It’s possible to get a good harvest from the plants, without too much hard work. When grown inside, average yields are about 300 grams per square metre, and outdoors, they’re approximately 500 grams per plant. Holland’s Hope Regular has the distinct advantage of being well suited to cooler growing conditions. This makes it a favourite of growers in colder countries. The plants also benefit from lollipopping or supercropping. Effect, taste, and smell of Holland’s Hope RegularAs a 90% indica strain, it’s unsurprising that Holland’s Hope Regular seeds by White Label produce a potent mind-and-body stone. Some users describe the high as sedative and calming, and claim that it induces sleepiness too. The aroma of the plants is classically indica in personality; an earthy, slightly spicy scent that’s skunk-like and pungent. This smell is fairly intense, and it carries through to the flavour too, upon consumption. Did you know? Holland’s Hope Regular was one of the first strains to be developed for colder climates (like The Netherlands).The plants are mold-resistant. Although Holland’s Hope Regular thrives in cooler conditions, it’s also capable of flourishing in warmer environments.

They remain nicely compact (generally under 1 m) and are ready to harvest after just 45 to 55 days in flower. With the love, care and nurturing they need, these plants will deliver a lush yield. 350 g/m² is perfectly possible. A Sea of Green (SOG), with lots of small plants next to each other rather than a few large plants, yields the best results. To ensure the plants grow as homogeneously as possible, it is best to use clones from the same mother plant. Cali Orange Bud Regular is less challenging than the original strain. But it’s still a ‘Californian Girl’ at heart and likes things warm and sunny. Anyone fortunate enough to live in a Mediterranean climate can also grow this strain outside in the open air.

White Haze Regular by White Label growth patternWith a THC-content of over 20%, Haze strains are not for the faint-hearted. It started with pure sativas originating from Thailand, Mexico and India. These gained great popularity in California during the 1970s, before reaching Europe. But cultivation proved exceptionally sluggish. Long flowering times and low yields made life hard for European growers. So Sensi Seeds began to cross Haze strains with indicas, resulting in some famous strains. Our Silver Haze was familiar to every cannabis fan; less well-known, but no less interesting, is White Haze.The buds on this beauty are surrounded by a thick white layer of trichomes, from where it takes its name. There’s no doubt, the literally hair-raising resin production is a real highlight of these hybrids. With 70% sativa genes, White Haze Regular by White Label combines a popular Haze high with benefits more usually associated with indica lines. These include the conical-shaped dense flower clusters typical of a hybrid.We have successfully reduced the average flowering time to 50 to 70 days, and at the same time increased yields. We also managed to get the height to a manageable level. But because it’s still a Haze strain, there needs to be sufficient ceiling height in the growing room. There is minimal risk of mould, although the plants should be checked for insects and parasites from time to time.A Screen of Green (SCROG) promises particularly good results. This strain also responds positively to Supercropping and Lollipopping. Remember that this is an indoor strain. Outdoor cultivation has a chance of success only in a warm, preferably tropical climate.Effect, flavour and smell of White Haze Regular by White LabelHaze strains are loved for their euphoric, some would even say psychedelic effect.

It’s 80% indica and 20% sativa, and thanks to this mix, users report feeling uplifted, happy, and wonderfully relaxed. White Ice Regular also has a short flowering time; great for growers that want results in a hurry. Growth pattern of White Ice Regular by White LabelWhite Ice Regular by White Label cannabis seeds are 80% indica, and 20% sativa. They have formidable genetics; a three-way mix of an Afghani Hash, a Dutch Skunk and Northern Lights. This means that the plants have a short flowering time, yield good harvests, and produce a high that’s both relaxing and cerebral. This is the regular version of the strain, and as such, will produce both male and female plants. This means that the plants can be used to generate seeds for future grows. Some experienced growers can also use the seeds to cross-breed with other variants. White Ice Regular has a fairly short flowering time, of 45 to 55 days. Thanks to its largely indica genetics, the plants don’t grow to excessive heights. When cultivated inside, the average height is around 80 to 100 cm. The plants are usually taller when grown outdoors, with some reaching as tall as 200 to 300 cm. The structure of White Ice Regular is distinctive. It’s almost like a Christmas tree in appearance, with sparkling white resin on the buds, which usually form around the central stem. The strain offers good yields too. Inside, the plants will usually produce around 450 grams per square metre, and outside, each plant yields about 400 grams. It thrives in warmer climates, though can manage in slightly cooler, temperate conditions. Indoors, the strain can be grown all year round. Experienced growers may get good results from both the supercropping and lollipopping training techniques. Effect, taste, and smell of White Ice RegularWhite Ice Regular is an indica-dominant strain. However, while the high is unmistakably indica in effect (relaxing, soothing and calm), the sativa influence is also evident. Users can expect to feel happy and uplifted too, and keep a clear head throughout.The scent of White Ice Regular is particularly pleasant; sweet, fruity and rich. This aroma becomes more pungent as the plants mature, and upon consumption, users usually notice its deep, smoky aftertaste. Did you know?

No wonder when you think that this is a further development of White Widow. Ready for the next generation?Just as Super Skunk carried on the Skunk #1 success story, White Rhino Regular by White Label is heading for new shores. The aim was clear from the outset: to increase the resin production of White Widow without compromising on the potency. And that was possible thanks to a hand-picked Afghanica. The end result is that White Rhino Regular by White Label is a mix of three super-stable landraces from Brazil, South India and Afghanistan. White Rhino Regular by White Label growth patternAs might be expected from a strain with 90% indica, the plants remain very compact during the flowering phase. They have only an average height gain, and flower quickly; indoors after around 45 to 60 days, and outdoors at the end of October. You can expect densely packed buds with white and orange pistils. Because White Rhino Regular by White Label is an exceptionally resinous strain, the dried buds are suitable for the production of concentrates such as hash oil, wax or shatter. Growers who have mastered the entire art of cannabis cultivation can obtain a yield of up to 800 g from a single plant. As well as perfectly fertilised soil, this also requires well-regulated watering and lighting. This cannabis strain flourishes magnificently in a growing room or greenhouse. Outdoor cultivation should be considered only in a warm, sunny climate.Whether Screen of Green (SCROG), Sea of Green (SOG) or Lollipopping: special growing and pruning techniques sit in perfect harmony with White Rhino Regular by White Label. Effect, flavour and smell of White Rhino Regular by White LabelGrown and dried correctly, the buds from this marijuana strain contain a lot of trichomes (glands). Not only does this make them look stunning, it also means they are highly potent. It’s the high THC count, up to 20%, that delivers the powerful high. The cannabinoid profile is complemented with CBD and CBN. Many users experience the effect of White Rhino as pleasant, relaxing and soporific. But as with all THC-rich strains, caution is urged for users with no tolerance. Flavour-wise, this strain is a spicy combination of earthy and woody aromas accompanied by a sweet undertone.Did you know?The mother plant of White Rhino, White Widow, is one of the best-known cannabis strains in the world.

Expect an uplifting high coupled with a deep sense of relaxation, ideal for dissolving tension. It’s easy to cultivate, even for beginners; growers with a little experience can achieve very large harvests. The scents and tastes are on the sweet side of the skunk family, with bright citrus top-notes. Growth pattern of Super Skunk Regular by White LabelWhite Label’s Super Skunk Regular is one of the earliest iterations of the original Skunk #1. It combines the original with a premium Afghan cultivar, which boosts yields and potency, and shortens the flowering period. The plants tend to flower for around seven weeks, producing substantial yields during this time. It’s an 80% indica, and this strong heritage is evident in the plant’s bushy form, sturdy stems and dense, chunky buds. Flowers usually develop around the nodes first, then more buds rapidly appear during flowering, until the internodal stems are concealed almost entirely. This strain can be grown outside, though it requires plenty of warmth and sunlight. Temperate or continental climates are ideal. Anticipate significant growth when planted in free soil, with lots of bulking and height. Harvests are also likely to be more impressive. Indoors, White Label Super Skunk Regular cannabis seeds produce plants that grow to an average height, and respond well to lollipopping techniques. The plants are also suitable for pinching out, topping, or fimming, which help create multiple central stems and colas. This is the case regardless of whether they’re planted inside, outside, or in a greenhouse. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk Regular by White LabelDuring the vegetative stage, Super Skunk Regular doesn’t produce a strong scent. However, once flowering is underway, the recognisable skunky aroma starts to become noticeable. This intensifies as time goes on, reaching a peak at the point of harvest. When consumed, the predominant flavours are warm earth and skunk, combined with top notes of pineapple and other tropical fruits. This is different to other skunk strains, which tend to produce garlicky, cheesy flavours. Super Skunk is 80% indica and 20% sativa, and both these influences are discernible after consumption. Users will experience a powerful sense of relaxation, alongside a sense of joy and merriment; a pleasant combination indeed. Did you know?

To ensure that none of the delicious Haze high and flavour is lost, these regular cannabis seeds contain a racy Thai strain in addition to an Afghan plant. Amnesia White Regular by White Label growth patternThe result is a sativa hybrid (70% sativa, 30% indica) that continues the Haze cannabis success story. Amnesia White Regular by White Label produces buds that grow into a point and that are so heavy with resin that they sparkle like gemstones. Compared with traditional Haze strains, both the flowering time and the height have been reduced – while increasing yields!Indoors, the plants reach around 120 to 160 cm in height, and can be harvested after 60 to 80 days. All this can be reduced further with a short vegetation phase and a Screen of Green (SCROG), where the tips of the plants are secured to mesh netting. This cannabis strain is also suitable for a Sea of Green (SOG). This cultivation method sees up to 25 plants placed under a light source. Clones from regular cannabis seeds produce strong and resilient plants. They need to be well ventilated to prevent pests and mould. That is of course less of a problem outside in the fresh air. Outdoor growing will be successful only in a sunny or Mediterranean climate, however. In California, Amnesia White Regular by White Label can reach over 3 m high.

In addition to the fantastic resin production, it is known for its uplifting high and almost psychedelic effect.Jack Herer® Regular by White Label growth patternJack Herer® Regular by White Label has much in common with the original strain: Three of the four phenotypes are sativa-dominant, with the fourth more indica-like. It grows more quickly, yet remains quite compact with a thick bud structure. This range of phenotypes is totally normal for a 50/50 hybrid, and a benefit in many ways. It allows growers to select the perfect mother plants for their flavour preference. The female plants with their distinct sativa traits and a manageable height combined with good yields are particularly popular. Indoor growers should not underestimate these plants’ height gain, however: two weeks in the vegetation phase is generally sufficient. Jack fans will happily tell you what comes next. Resin-rich calyxes form at several points, lending the plants a wild appearance. Fist-sized buds bursting with pistils are not uncommon with this cannabis strain.

It stimulates the mind and body, and is absolutely predestined for creative work. Many cannabis fans won’t touch anything else once they’ve tried a Haze strain. The effect and flavour are right up there. Growing expensive Haze seeds often results in disillusionment. At European latitudes in particular, the towering plants cannot complete their flowering phase in time. Our White Label experts set out to solve this problem.Kali Haze Regular by White Label growth patternCrossing a Haze strain with North Indian and Jamaican genetics has successfully alleviated many of the properties of original Haze. In particular with respect to height gain and flowering time. With 75% sativa and 25% indica genes, Kali Haze Regular by White Label is still a tall-growing strain, but in its current form it’s suitable for indoor cultivation. Use a Screen of Green (SCROG) to achieve the great yield potential of around 400 g/m². Mesh netting restricts height gain and bud formation. The density and weight of resin-soaked buds are properties rarely encountered with Haze hybrids. The buds slowly fill the spaces between the internode gaps, and tend to spread out along all the stems and branches. Kali Haze Regular by White Label is a regular strain that produces both female and male plants. In a growing room, they can be made to form buds early. If growing outdoors, this works only when the daylight period becomes considerably shorter. That means October at most latitudes. Please note that outdoor growing will be successful only in a sunny climate with warm summers.Effect, flavour and smell of Kali Haze Regular by White LabelThe name ‘Kali’ is a reference to the Indian deity Kali, and the home of the original Haze strain in sunny California.

It’s not a strain for novices, but for fans with experience. X Haze Feminized by White Label growth patternThe first Haze strains were created in the USA by two brothers with the surname Haze. During the 1980s, Dutch growers, including our company founder Ben Dronkers, imported Haze strains and crossed them with genes from other, mainly indica-dominated strains. Our Hindu Kush, for example, played an important part in modern cannabis cultivation. X Haze Feminized by White Label produces only female plants, which eliminates the need to weed out the male shoots at the start of the flowering period. As soon as these cannabis seeds germinate, they grow like the clappers. Since these are tall-growing plants, the growing room must be correspondingly high. If that’s not possible, use a Screen of Green (SCROG). There’s a nice side effect: a SCROG further increases the already good yields. This cannabis strain is also suitable for other advanced techniques such as Supercropping and Lollipopping. The genes comprise 60% sativa and 40% indica. It’s clear from looking at the growth structure and bud formation that the sativa genes are dominant. But the experts among you will know that the added density is down to the indica gene. Watching this cannabis strain grow is a real joy – X Haze Feminized by White Label quickly gains in height and width until, towards the end of the flowering time, the top half of the plants and the main branches are covered with crystalline, elongated buds. It takes 65 to 80 days to reach this stage. Note that this is an indoor strain. Growing outdoors should be considered only in a Mediterranean or tropical climate with long, warm summers. In the hands of experienced growers, these cannabis plants turn into true cannabis trees. Effect, flavour and smell of X Haze Feminized by White LabelQuite honestly, Haze strains are loved primarily for their high THC content and euphoric and stimulating effect. The sudden banging high from X Haze fits this profile perfectly. While the senses are bewitched, the body remains fully functioning. Inexperienced users should take things slowly; too much THC is not a nice thing. The full citrus flavour is down to the indica gene. It is very refreshing, and adds to the user experience. This weed tastes even better in a vaporizer – without any tobacco. Did you know?It’s no secret that Haze strains are particularly popular among musicians. There are countless songs that have the word ‘Haze’ in the title, including ‘Purple Haze’ by Paul Gilbert and the Kottonmouth Kings, ‘Blue Haze’ by Miles Davis and ‘Haze of Fame’ by Tangerine Dream.</description><meta_title>X Haze Feminized Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>X Haze Feminized by White Label is a sativa-dominant Haze strain with an intensive high.

This really comes out in the high; a total-body stone which inspires relaxation and creativity. The plants are short enough to be cultivated discreetly, and don’t produce much scent while growing. They have a short flowering time, and generally generate bumper yields. Growth pattern of Northern Lights FeminizedNorthern Lights Feminized cannabis seeds are 90% indica and 10% sativa. The plants they produce are typically indica in stature; compact, bushy and broad-leaved. The indica dominance can also be detected in the high, which is relaxing and serene. Thanks to the genetics being back-crossed with the original Afghani plant, the strain is swift to flower, and produces plentiful resinous buds. This version of the strain is feminized, which means it’s very unlikely to produce any male plants. This ensures that cultivation is exceptionally straight-forward. The plants also have a short flowering time, of just 45 to 55 days. As such, it’s a popular strain with growers that want to generate multiple harvests each year, or who just want quick results. Like most indica-dominant strains, Northern Lights Feminized plants are short in stature. Average plants tend to grow to around 100 to 120 cm, particularly when grown indoors (though on occasion, they can grow as tall as 160 cm). Outside, they’re likely to grow taller, with some reaching 180 to 220 cm. The plants are very indica in appearance, with a compact, stocky structure. They’ll typically have plenty of branches and are bushy, with broad leaves. The buds are large and solid, and towards the end of the flowering period, are covered in sticky resin. Northern Lights Feminized’s yields are particularly impressive; another major draw of this strain. Indoors, it’s not uncommon for growers to harvest around 500-550 grams per square metre. Outside, the yield is no less sizeable, with a single plant often producing around 575 to 625 grams. Mediterranean climates are ideal for Northern Lights Feminized, as it grows well in warm, sunny countries that have reliably long summers. The plants can also be grown inside all year round, or in a greenhouse. They are well suited to a variety of different training systems. SOG (Sea of Green) and SCROG (Screen of Green) are both effective, as are lollipopping and supercropping. Effect, taste, and smell of Northern Lights FeminizedThis strain is 90% indica, and users report a typically indica high upon consumption. Like many indica-dominant variants, the stone is heady, relaxing and intense, with some claiming to feel more creative or thoughtful while experiencing it.

This is a big advantage for those that want to cultivate it discreetly, or who don’t want the scent to overpower their home.

The prepared buds have a more noticeable aroma, with hints of fruit and pine, as well as the original tangy earthiness. After tasting, users claim that the strain has a definite hint of lemon, with a pleasant hit of sweetness too. Did you know?

Each pack contains an assorted selection of seeds from our feminized varieties, giving growers the excitement of a mixed harvest for minimal investment. Growth pattern of Female Mix by White LabelFemale Mix cannabis seeds come in a range of different strains, including indica, sativa, and hybrids. The seeds aren’t named or labelled in the pack, but growers with some experience should be able to identify the type of plant based on the leaves and growth pattern. This gives a good indication of where the plant lies on the indica / sativa spectrum. Indoor growers who are keen to harvest all the plants at the same time may want to put the sativas into flower first. This gives the plants a chance to complete their longer flowering period, then finish at the same time as the indica-dominant varieties with their shorter blooming time. Not only do the cannabis varieties in Female Mix by White Label offer different flowering times, they also come in a range of different heights. Sativas will typically triple in height during the later stages of flowering. Please note that there are likely to be plenty of hybrids in each pack of Female Mix, which can make it tricky to precisely identify which strain a plant is. However, the pack provides a good opportunity to experiment with different training and pruning techniques, such as lollipopping and supercropping. The Sea of Green (SOG) and Screen of Green (SCROG) methods are better suited to homogenous crops. Since this is a mix of strains, it’s recommended that the seeds are cultivated indoors, or outdoors in a reliably warm and sunny climate. This ensures that the sativas have enough time to finish flowering before the temperatures drop. Effect, taste, and smell of Female Mix by White LabelWhite Label’s Female Mix features many different strains of cannabis. As such, the flavours, scents and effects are extremely diverse. This is a large part of the pack’s appeal. Some of the most commonly included scents and tastes include citrus, warm spice, rich pine, sweet candy and many more. Likewise, the effects vary considerably, with indica-dominant plants offering a sense of relaxation, and sativas being typically uplifting and euphoric. After harvesting the buds, some growers choose to store each plant’s yield separately, then guess which strain they might be sampling. Others enjoy mixing them together to create their own unique ‘cannabis cocktail’. Did you know?

With its short flowering time and robust nature, this strain is unsurprisingly popular with growers of all experience levels. This is a great choice for anyone seeking large harvests of trichome-covered buds without a great deal of effort. Growth pattern of Super Skunk Feminized by White LabelWhite Label’s Super Skunk Feminized is 80% indica. As with other indica-dominant variants, the plants are sturdy and strong, with thick stems and branches. They produce large, heavy buds, which grow between the nodes during the flowering stage. The plant’s main cola, if left to its own devices, can take over the top stem. This means it’s well suited to methods such as trimming, fimming, pinching out or topping. These create multiple stems. More experienced growers may achieve good results with lollipopping, and with the Sea of Green (SOG) and Screen of Green (SCROG) techniques. Super Skunk Feminized cannabis seeds grow into average sized plants. They have a short flowering period (around 45 to 50 days), which is surprising, given how plentiful their yields are, and how dense and chunky the buds are. This is due to the Afghan parentage, which has been bred with the original Skunk strain to bring out the indica elements. Beginners can achieve good results with this strain, and experienced growers can definitely capitalise on the plants’ full potential. This strain is well suited to being cultivated indoors (typical for a Skunk variant). However, it is possible to grow the plants outdoors, providing they’re in a climate that benefits from warm, long summers. Super Skunk Feminized thrives in pots, where it will become large and bushy whether outdoors or inside under lights. Outdoors in free soil, the height is likely to be far greater. The strain is also well-suited for growing in greenhouses, though it’s recommended that the plants are kept short, to prevent the plants from pushing against the roof. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk Feminized by White LabelWhite Label’s Super Skunk Feminized, unlike some other types of skunk, has an almost tropical scent, especially after it has been cured. While growing, it produces a pungent, sweet aroma, with nutty, earthy base notes. Once the flowers start to emerge, growers will detect a hint of the classic skunk smell: astringent and immediately recognisable. The scent can become intense, especially during the flowering stage. As this is only seven weeks, indoor growers shouldn’t find it too problematic, as long as they have carbon filters on their air extraction. Many users recommend giving the harvested buds time to cure properly. This enables them to develop a full flavour profile. Upon consumption, Super Skunk Feminized offers a potent relaxing effect, which relieves feelings of stress, and muscle tension. Some people recommend it as the perfect evening strain, as it can also bring about a sense of jollity and fun. Did you know?

Most of the buds tend to form around its sturdy central stem, and are large and heavy. Considering how compact White Ice Feminized can be, it produces exceptionally impressive yields. Indoors, under artificial lighting, growers often generate around 400 to 450 grams per square metre. When cultivated outside, a single plant will frequently produce as much as 650 grams. The strain is well suited for outdoor growth, but needs plenty of warmth and sunlight over an extended period of time. Locations like the Mediterranean are ideal, and harvesting should take place before any rain sets in.Growers find that the plants respond well to training techniques like SCROG (Screen of Green) and SOG (Sea of Green), and that lollipopping and supercropping are also effective.

White Gold was created by crossing a White Widow with Himalayan Gold. The result is a wonderful hybrid that is based on 60% indica and 40% sativa genes, and that is in no way inferior to its famous parents. The medium-sized plants result in average height gain during the flowering stage. In common with many indica-heavy strains, the leaves and buds can take on a purple tone – provided it’s not too warm. It’s time to harvest when the buds are covered with a syrupy resin. That generally takes seven to nine weeks. It is characterised by long, dark and furry buds with orange-coloured pistils. White Gold Feminized by White Label really plays its aces when it comes to trichomes and yield. Likes its well-known mother, White Widow, it produces copious resin from which hashish can be created, and which also lends the buds their great potency. Because the feminized version of White Gold is relatively undemanding and delivers large yields, it is equally popular among commercial growers and novices alike. It is primarily a plant for indoor cultivation, but can also be grown outdoors in sunny and warm climates. The best results are achieved with a SOG (Sea of Green) or SCROG (Screen of Green). However, the plants also flourish wonderfully in a conventional set-up or hydroponic system. Effect, flavour and smell of White Gold Feminized by White LabelDo you like to be creative? Then you’ll appreciate the hybrid effect. Some caution is urged however, since this cannabis strain has a high THC content, which can result in unwanted side effects in some people.The taste and smell of this strain captivate with a tropical and fruity tone, accentuated by a Haze smell and earthy notes. In this respect, it clearly differentiates itself by White Widow, which has a more neutral, some would even say more boring flavour. Warning: these seeds are not the right choice for stealth growers who value discretion. The growing plants smell too strong for that.Did you know?We also sell White Gold Regular by White Label seeds.</description><meta_title>White Gold Feminized Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>White Gold Feminized by White Label has it all: first-rate resin production, XXL harvests, a high THC content and a wonderfully fruity flavour.</meta_description><url><![CDATA[https://sensiseeds.com/en/feminized-seeds/whitelabel/white-gold-feminised]]></url><image><![CDATA[https://img.sensiseeds.com/en/feminized-seeds/whitelabel/white-gold-feminised-thumb.png]]></image><price>120</price><currency>eur</currency><in_stock>Yes</in_stock><category>Feminised Seeds</category><flowering_min>50</flowering_min><flowering_max>65</flowering_max><strain_type>Feminized</strain_type><number_of_seeds>10</number_of_seeds><climate_zone>Sunny / Mediterranean</climate_zone><yield>XXL Yield</yield><heigh_gain>Average height gain</heigh_gain></item><item><itemtype>Product</itemtype><id>1520010</id><title>Skunk #1 Feminized Seeds by White Label</title><description>Skunk #1 feminized seeds by White Label produce highly robust female hybrid plants (65% indica, 35% sativa). Even novices can achieve lush yields.Skunk #1 Feminized by White Label growth patternSkunk #1 Feminized comprises 65% indica and 35% sativa genes. This is the first successfully stabilised cannabis hybrid. Its origins go back to landraces such as Afghani, Acapulco Gold and Colombian Gold. Generations of intensive selection and backcrossing were required prior to the birth of Skunk #1. Only the finest examples were considered. The result is evident: for breeders, Skunk #1 sets the standard in terms of uniform and reliable performance.The dense buds and plentiful harvests from Skunk #1 highlight the true significance of hybrid power. Although the plants gain more in height than pure indicas, the growth and flowering are typically indica. Which means: a short growth period is followed by an equally short flowering time of around 45 to 50 days. Skunk #1 Feminized produces strong stems and shoots to support their large yields. In small gaps between branches, the shoots expand to finished formations of buds that develop into powerfully heavy colas up until harvest. The sativa influence has a particular impact on the shape and structure of the buds.In a sunny, warm climate, these seeds thrive outside in the fresh air. Indoors, these plants are undemanding. We regularly hear from people who make a lot of growing mistakes, but achieve great results nevertheless. Skunk #1 is suitable for the most advanced cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG) and Lollipopping. Effect, flavour and smell of Skunk #1 Feminized by White LabelThe exceptional potency of this cannabis family is so notorious that ‘skunk’ is often used as the generic term for strong marijuana. The effect is best described as a combination of physical stone and heady high – a typical hybrid then. Small amounts trigger an active, animated high; larger amounts can turn this into a sedated feeling. The smell and taste of this strain are typically skunk: a mix of sour and earthy notes. Some people like it, while others turn up their nose. Users report a sweet sharpness reminiscent of old-school hashish. Did you know?Skunk #1 has won multiple Cannabis Cup awards.

As the name implies, it tends to have eye-catching purple flowers, and produces big yields. It’s sativa dominant, which means a chatty, energetic high. This means that it’s perfect for social situations. The sweet-and-sour aroma and short flowering times make this a firm favourite with growers across the globe. Growth pattern of Purple Haze FeminizedPurple Haze Feminized by White Label cannabis seeds are 80% sativa and 20% indica. Its sativa genetics really come to the foreground in the high, which is uplifting and energising. The strain has an impressive background, and is a hybrid of Purple Thai and a Haze variety. This parentage is evident in the sweet, tangy aroma, not to mention the violet-coloured flowers. It’s a feminized version of the strain, which means that the seeds are highly unlikely to produce any male plants. This makes cultivation much simpler. Purple Haze Feminized has a relatively quick flowering time of around 50 to 65 days. The plants are shorter than most Haze strains, which makes them more manageable if space is limited. Usually, they’ll reach around 110 to 150 cm in height. In terms of appearance, they have long internodal spaces and lateral branches. The long flowers are fluffy and tend to have distinctive purple colour running through them. White Label’s Purple Haze Feminized produces decent yields, which makes it popular with growers. Anticipate around 100 grams from each plant, or three to six ounces per square foot, regardless of whether it’s grown indoors or out. The buds usually have a spade-like structure, and are quite dense and heavy. In order to thrive outdoors, this strain needs a warm, sunny climate such as the Mediterranean. However, it can be grown indoors all year round. The SCROG (Screen of Green) and SOG (Sea of Green) growing systems both work well with Purple Haze Feminized, and the plants respond well to lollipopping and supercropping. Effect, taste, and smell of Purple Haze Feminized Purple Haze Feminized is a sativa-dominant strain. Users will realise this as soon as they consume it; as the resulting high kicks in quickly, and is energising and stimulating. Expect to experience a burst of creativity, together with a subtle sense of relaxation, which comes from the 20% indica genetics. The plants have a sweet, tangy scent while growing. After harvesting, the buds take on a more earthy, pungent aroma, with a hint of berry. This is carried through to the taste. Did you know? Purple Haze Feminized is named after the Jimi Hendrix song, which Hendrix claimed came to him in a dream. The intensity of the plant’s colour depends on the pH levels of the soil it’s grown in. Also, lower temperatures during flowering will likely to intensify the flowers’ violet hue. Purple Haze Feminized is regarded as a particularly easy strain to cultivate, which makes it a solid choice for novice growers.</description><meta_title>Purple Haze Feminized Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Purple Haze Feminized by White Label is 80% sativa, 20% indica.

The result is a reliable, surprisingly easy-to-grow hybrid strain that combines the typical diesel flavour with a pleasant high. White Diesel Feminized by White Label growth patternYou don’t need to be a petrolhead to like the smell of car fuel – and that includes lots of cannabis fans too. They can’t get enough of ‘diesel’ strains, around which a real hype has emerged during the past 20 years. Specific terpenes are responsible for the unique smell of these cannabis strains (more about this in the next section). White Diesel is a real hybrid. It comprises 40% sativa and 60% indica genes. It has also inherited its great resin production by White Widow, along with its frosty, white trichomes that glisten like tiny snowflakes in the sun. The sharp flavour, conversely, comes from its other parent, NYC Diesel. These feminized cannabis seeds produce only female plants which reach average height. White Diesel Feminized by White Label is easy to cultivate, and rewards growers with a plentiful harvest. When good isn’t good enough, special cultivation methods such as Screen of Green (SCROG), Sea of Green (SOG), Supercropping and Lollipopping may help. These techniques are excellently suited to this cannabis strain. White Diesel Feminized by White Label can also be grown outside in a Mediterranean climate with long summers. The flowering stage is on average 60 to 65 days. Effect, flavour and smell of White Diesel Feminized by White LabelThe effect and flavour are two of the main reasons for diesel strains having become so popular. Because they contain a lot of THC, this ‘green fuel’ is more suitable for experienced users. Unlike most other diesel strains, White Diesel Feminized by White Label doesn’t kick in immediately. It takes a few minutes to experience the first sense of a rush. First comes an uplifting, cerebral high, which after a while is accompanied by a very relaxing stone feeling. It’s the combination that counts: cannabis contains more than 100 terpenes that account for the smell as well as some of the effect. The diesel smell comes principally from α-pinene, α-caryophyllene and linalool. The bouquet is rounded off with fresh flavours ranging from lemon to grapefruit, depending on the phenotype. Did you know?The genetic origins of all diesel strains go back to the legendary Chemdog. In 1991, the rock band Grateful Dead played a concert in Indiana, during which a man called Chem Dog was looking for some weed. He met a couple of blokes who sold him some premium quality buds for USD 500. Chem Dog was so impressed with this weed that he went on to order some more, and grew a few plants of his own from it. ‘Chemdog D’ was created from one of the seeds and now enjoys a legendary reputation on the scene as well as being used for crosses even today.</description><meta_title>White Diesel Feminized Seeds by White Label</meta_title><meta_description>40% sativa and 60% indica: White Diesel Feminized by White Label smells of diesel, and is based on White Widow and NYC Diesel.

It’s easy to grow indoors, and compact enough even for those without much available space. It’s 75% indica, and this is evident in the high, which is a total-body stone. However, there’s a hint of sativa uplift too. The scent is pleasantly earthy and spicy, with a touch of sweet citrus. Growth pattern of Snow Ryder AutomaticSnow Ryder Automatic by White Label cannabis seeds are 75% indica, with sativa and ruderalis genetics incorporated into the mix. This results in a strain that’s compact and easy to cultivate, while offering a deep, intense all-body stone.This is an autoflowering variant, which means that flowering starts at a predetermined time, regardless of light cycles. This makes it much easier to cultivate, as there’s no uncertainty about when the plants will enter their flowering period. As for the flowering stage? It usually lasts about 55-65 days, which is slightly longer than other autoflowering varieties. However, the vegetation stage is short, which means the total life cycle isn’t too protracted. As with many indica-dominant strains, Snow Ryder Auto is relatively compact. Usually, the plants don’t tend to exceed 120 cm in height, regardless of whether they’re grown indoors or outside. They can be kept even shorter inside if required; with some growers stating that they’ve successfully limited the plant’s growth to as short as 40 cm. However, it’s important to note that it’s not a dwarf cannabis strain. White Label Snow Ryder plants are robust and slightly squat in appearance, which is usual with indica-dominant varieties. The internodes are close together, and the flowers have a uniquely icy, crystallised appearance. This is often white, but sometimes almost amber-coloured.For an autoflowering strain, Snow Ryder delivers pretty good yields. When grown indoors, it’s not unusual for the plants for produce around 450 grams per square metre. Outside, the results are less plentiful, but growers can still get around 200 grams per plant, if harvesting takes place before the start of September. The plants thrive in the sunny summer months, but as a sturdy auto strain, it can survive in more temperate climates too. It can be grown inside all year round. Effect, taste, and smell of Snow Ryder AutomaticWhite Label’s Snow Ryder Automatic is 75% indica, and the strong indica genetics are immediately obvious upon consumption. Despite being an auto, the strain is capable of producing a fairly potent stone, which is relaxing and soothing. Users report that it results in a sense of calm and wellbeing, both in body and mind. However, there’s also a hint of lift, which comes from the sativa influence. While growing, the plants produce a sweet, citrus-tinted aroma, which has a hint of dank earthiness to it. Once the buds are harvested, this smell becomes stronger, and takes on a spicier tone. To taste, users usually notice the citrus coming through, along with the tangy flavour of earth. Did you know? Snow Ryder Automatic earned its name thanks to the icy, crystallised resin that forms on its buds. When grown outside, growers usually plant the seeds by April, in order to flower during the warmest months. Snow Ryder Automatic is a good choice for growers with limited space, as the plants seldom grow taller than 120 cm.</description><meta_title>Snow Ryder Automatic Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Snow Ryder Automatic by White Label is 75% indica, 25% sativa.

Growth pattern of White Skunk Feminized by White LabelWhite Label’s White Skunk Feminized, like the other expressions of this strain, is 65% indica. As a hybrid, it has the short flowering time, and compact size of most indica cannabis plants. However, the 35% sativa element is evident too, in the open bud structure, and reduced lateral branching. When grown in pots, the size is likely to be smaller. Growers looking for an even more compact plant can shorten the vegetation period. Despite their usual short stature, it is possible to make the plants achieve impressive heights. If grown in a warm or temperate climate in free soil, it’s not uncommon for them to reach as two metres. White Skunk Feminized is a reliably homogenous strain. This means it’s easy to grow and maintain, even for novice gardeners. The plants respond well to topping, which is useful for growers looking to encourage more branching.

It’s easy to cultivate indoors or out, even in cold climates with summers that end quickly. Low temperatures will actually encourage the plants to become more purple as flowering progresses, resulting in a colourful harvest of dense buds. The effect is a long-lasting sense of cheerful relaxation, perfect for social or solo consumption.Growth pattern of Purple Bud FeminizedWhite Label’s Purple Bud Feminized cannabis seeds have been developed from the Hindu Kush range, which includes some of the most prized indica strains in the world. The plants are typically indica in growth structure, with sturdy, short stems and branches. However, they’re a little taller than average indicas, which gives away their sativa component. Purple Bud Feminized can be kept compact by ensuring the vegetation stage is short; alternatively, the plants can be made taller by extending it. The strain is robust and able to withstand most minor cultivation issues. Even those with little experience should be able to generate good results from this strain; along with White Skunk, it is recognised as an excellent ‘beginner’s option’.Purple Bud Feminized has a short flowering time, with a blooming cycle of about nine weeks. During this time, a sizeable yield of purple flowers appears around the nodes, and up the stem and branches. The buds are dense, solid and spiky, and have a thick coating of trichomes. As with all ‘purple weed’ strains, the leaves and flowers may begin to turn violet if exposed to lower temperatures. However, as each plant is an individual, some of them will always remain green. This is due to naturally occurring variation, and is very much a characteristic of this type of cannabis. However, the Purple Bud family has been carefully bred to maximise purple coloration, and many of the plants will display shades of purple as the flowering stage comes to an end. Some may even have purple-hued leaves, while others will retain green leaves which contrast beautifully with the purple cannabis flowers. Purple Bud Feminized grows well indoors, and the Sea of Green (SOG) and Screen of Green (SCROG) methods are both good options during cultivation. The plants also respond well to topping, which creates multiple main stems and colas. It can be grown outside, in temperate and continental climates. When planted in early spring, in free soil, Purple Bud Feminized is capable of achieving considerable heights for a ‘compact’ plant, and is likely to produce an excellent harvest.

This aroma intensifies as the plant enters the flowering period. Upon consumption, growers will notice that the sweet notes come through strongly, and are balanced with a hint of spice and pine. Some people favour vaping the buds to ensure that the flavours are fully released. Thanks to its indica / sativa parentage, Purple Bud Feminized produces an initial uplifting high. This then smoothly develops into a deeply relaxing feeling, which can last a couple of hours or longer. Some users claim that it’s a good ‘bedtime’ option, as it has a pleasantly soporific effect. However, larger quantities can have the opposite effect and make the mind more active.Did you know?

If Skunk #1 Auto is germinated in the springtime and planted outdoors, it may even be ready to harvest in cool regions in the June. Unlike traditional plants, the yield from autoflowering seeds is much lower, although more yields per year can be achieved when growing outdoors.As with all autoflowering cannabis strains, buds form automatically. With Skunk #1 Automatic by White Label, that happens in around the sixth week of the growth period, so around the time that the plants form their fifth to seventh set of true leaves.

This is a hybrid with 50% sativa and 50% indica genes.White Haze Automatic by White Label growth patternHaze strains are notoriously difficult to grow. Logical, really, when you think that they originate from tropical countries such as Thailand and Mexico. As pure sativas, they grew to over 3 m high, and had a long flowering stage. Crossing them with indicas has reduced the height gain, and increased the yield at the same time. They are now fit for climate zones outside the tropics, as it were. White Haze Automatic cannabis seeds by White Label mark the current high point of this development. These seeds will give even growers without green fingers robust cannabis plants that reach a maximum height of 140 cm, and which can be harvested 12 to 16 weeks after sowing Just three months for the entire life cycle? Yes! Thanks to the Sensi Seeds breeders who paired a White Haze with a Cannabis Ruderalis. The result is a hybrid comprising half sativa and half indica genes. Following a short vegetation phase, these plants automatically move into the flowering phase. In other words, growers have no need to adjust the lighting period. Here’s another benefit of this strain: because these are feminised seeds, there’s no need to weed out the male shoots at the start of flowering. Why complicate things when it’s so easy? Effect, flavour and smell of White Haze Automatic by White LabelThe plants exude their captivating, sharp and sweet scent towards the end of the flowering period. The buds should be sticky at this stage. That is because of the white glands (trichomes) from which this strain derives its name. They can be collected with a dry sieve, and then pressed into hashish. And smoked as weed, White Haze Auto by White Label also delivers the euphoric high characteristic of Haze strains. Fits of the giggles are also the order of the day. Thanks to the indica gene, the uplifting high is followed by a relaxing, physical stone feeling.The taste is dominated by earthy pine tones which, depending on the phenotype, may be accompanied by citrus notes.Did you know?Haze and music go together like yin and yang. And not just in the hip-hop scene, which is especially open to ganja.Incidentally, this cannabis strain is also available as White Haze Regular by White Label. It won 1st prize at the Cannabis Cup 2002.</description><meta_title>White Haze Automatic Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>White Haze Automatic by White Label comprises 50% sativa and 50% indica genes.

It can be grown almost anywhere, from sunny windowsills to gardens in cold wet climates with short summers. Super Skunk is famous for its award-winning combination of happy high and powerful stress relief; this autoflowering variation makes these benefits available to more gardeners than ever before.Growth pattern of Super Skunk Automatic by White LabelWhite Label’s Super Skunk Automatic is compact, with relatively few branches. It’s strong and sturdy, and produces colas with big, sticky calyxes. Visually, it closely resembles other indicas, with a typically ‘Christmas tree’ form. This cannabis strain is 80% indica. Its buds are dense and lime green. Much of the flower growth occurs on the central cola. Techniques like fimming or topping aren’t suitable in this instance, as autoflowering strains don’t have a long enough vegetation cycle to allow the methods to take effect. Super Skunk Automatic is a great choice for gardeners who want a skunk that can thrive in cold, damp climates with short summers. The combined genetics of Super Skunk and a premium Ruderalis results in robust plants with a short flowering time of around seven weeks. The plants will automatically begin blooming around six weeks after germination. The plants are slightly smaller than other similar strains, which means yields can be lighter. However, they are ‘harvest ready’ more quickly than other plants, which can be an advantage. Some growers maximise Super Skunk Auto’s potential by planting the seedlings in large pots, as soon as they grow their first set of true leaves. This approach is unusual for cannabis in general, but is recommended for autoflowering strains as they can catch growers by surprise with how swiftly they start flowering. Having a large space for root growth right from the start means that the plants can vegetate and flower without any further disturbance. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk Automatic by White LabelThe scent of Super Skunk Automatic is usually mild during the vegetation stage. Once flowering is well established, the smell intensifies. It becomes more skunky and sweet, with strong, earthy base-notes. After harvesting and curing the buds, you’ll notice that they have a similarly pungent aroma.When consumed, people often notice top-notes of lemon and grapefruit, which nicely complement the spicy earthiness. Super Skunk Automatic offers a pleasant sense of relaxation when consumed. This is due to its indica parentage. The 20% sativa content ensures a cheerful accompanying high. It’s not an intense effect (especially when cultivated outdoors), which makes it a good choice for casual users, or those who have a low tolerance to cannabis. More practiced users are likely to enjoy this strain as a daytime choice. Did you know?

It’s 90% indica, which can be detected in the calming, total-body stone. The intensity of the high is impressive, especially for an autoflowering strain. As well as a speedy harvest, growers also appreciate the pleasantly earthy, fruity aroma, and the compact height.Growth pattern of Northern Lights AutomaticNorthern Lights Automatic cannabis seeds are 90% indica. It’s believed that the strain originally came from the US. After being taken to The Netherlands, White Label developed their own version of the strain. This contemporary variant features the same Afghani and Thai heritage, with the inclusion of a ruderalis. It’s an autoflowering strain, which makes it a solid choice for novice growers. Automatic varieties offer a more predictable, reliable grow. Northern Lights Auto also has a rapid flowering period of just 45 to 50 days. This makes it possible to produce multiple harvests in one year. It’s also a bonus for those who want to get results as quickly as possible. Another advantage of this strain is its small height gain, which is to be expected from an indica-dominant plant. Growers can usually anticipate more limited growth, which makes this a suitable strain for those with less space. White Label Northern Lights Auto plants are compact, with a stocky, sturdy appearance, and lots of dense branches. The leaves are broad and relatively flat, and the buds, when they’re nearing harvest time, are thickly coated with shining resin. They’re also large and chunky. Though this is an autoflowering strain, it still offers a sizeable yield, especially when compared to other auto varieties. Those looking for a super-sized harvest may want to consider the Feminized variant instead. Northern Lights Automatic is robust, and as such, it’s well suited to even cooler European climates. It can be grown outdoors, or inside at any time of the year. Cultivation in a greenhouse is also an option. Effect, taste, and smell of Northern Lights AutomaticNorthern Lights Automatic is indica-dominant, which is obvious in the resulting high; potent, sedative, and intense. As with many indica strains, it produces an all-over sense of relaxation; though some users also claim to feel more creative or thoughtful after consuming it. Inexperienced users should be aware that Northern Lights Auto is capable of producing a powerful stone.The strain doesn’t generate a powerful odour while growing, which is beneficial for those cultivating the plants indoors. Up close, a subtle scent of earthiness and pine can be detected, with mildly fruity undertones. The aroma only intensifies after harvesting. Then, users may notice a citrus smell, along with a hint of spiciness. This carries through to the taste, which is lemony, earthy and pungent. Did you know? It’s available in one other variant – Northern Lights Feminized by White Label. The strain is often mentioned in hip-hop lyrics. Northern Lights Automatic doesn’t produce much smell, and is usually compact in size. This makes it appealing for those that want to cultivate plants discreetly.</description><meta_title>Northern Lights Automatic Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>White Label’s Northern Lights Automatic is a 90% indica strain.

This cannabis strain was created by crossing a White Diesel with Cannabis Ruderalis. The result is an autoflowering strain with an easy nature. Even novices can achieve top results. Following a short growth phase, the plants begin to flower as if by magic. This happens automatically, with no need to adjust the lighting period.

White Widow Automatic seeds by White Label combine the strengths of the original with the simplicity of an autoflowering strain – a great choice not just for novices! White Widow Automatic by White Label growth patternThere are now many commercial providers of autoflowering cannabis, but only a few strains deliver what they promise. White Widow Auto by White Label is justifiably one of the most popular autoflowering varieties. Just like the original, it comprises 65% indica and 35% sativa genes. The cross with Ruderalis plants yielded a strong hybrid.There are many advantages to autoflowering strains. Because the plants start to flower automatically after a while, growers don’t need to grapple with lighting cycles and light spectrums. Autoflowering cannabis is undemanding, and is forgiving of growing mistakes as well as temperature fluctuations. Because this is a strain of feminized seeds, which produce female plants only, there’s no need to weed out male shoots. Flowering begins just three to four weeks after germination. The entire life cycle through to harvest takes around 75 days. This allows two summer harvests to be achieved on the same patch. With indoor cultivation, as many as three to four harvests are achievable per year. Compared with normal strains, autoflowering plants are nicely compact, but have a slightly lower yield as a result. A Sea of Green (SOG) can combat this. Effect, flavour and smell of White Widow Automatic by White LabelWhite Widow Automatic by White Label delivers a chilled high. The dried buds have a more distinct body stone effect than the normal and feminized version.

It loves cold climates, which will bring out the tones of lilac, violet and burgundy which many of the plants develop. The combination of autoflowering ruderalis with our original Purple Bud Feminized makes for a reliable crop that provides happiness and relaxation.Growth pattern of Purple Bud Automatic Seeds by White LabelPurple Bud Automatic cannabis seeds contain genetics from two premium Afghan hash plants. This parentage is evident in Purple Bud Automatic’s stocky form and rapid flowering. However, it’s not a completely indica strain. A Jamaican cultivar provides Purple Bud with 25% sativa genetics, and ruderalis genes add autoflowering capabilities. The sativa component gives the plants a little more height than the average indica, with mature plants reaching around 90 to 140 centimetres. Cultivation usually takes around 14 weeks in total. The flowering stage lasts between eight and 10 weeks. As with all autoflowering varieties, gardeners can enjoy substantial yields without having to put too much effort in, or have a great deal of expertise. Purple Bud Auto’s buds initially appear as spiky calyxes around the bracts and nodes on the upper branches and stem. These flowers then swell in size, becoming chunkier and more dense. In the last few weeks of blooming, the buds merge together to form colas. Due to the nature of autoflowering cannabis plants, yields are typically slightly less than Regular or Feminized versions. Most growers see this as a fair trade-off for the ease of cultivation, and the ability to grow the plants in colder climates. This auto strain can be grown virtually anywhere, even indoors on a sunny windowsill. As with most autoflowering cannabis plants, Purple Bud Automatic doesn’t suit many grow techniques. However, the Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG) and lollipopping techniques are worth trying for gardeners who want to experiment. Purple Bud Automatic has a rapid growth cycle, which means that growers in warmer climates can achieve two harvests in a single summer. This can be easy if the first crop is started at the end of March, then the second straight after the harvesting of the first. Effect, taste, and smell of Purple Bud Automatic by White LabelWhite Label’s Purple Bud Automatic has a pleasant, earthy aroma, with hints of pine.

The plants have a wonderfully distinctive peppery, spicy scent, and the buds have delicious notes of citrus. Thanks to its indica parentage, it’s a compact strain and can be grown discreetly. The incorporation of ruderalis genetics means that the plants flourish even in colder climates. Growth pattern of Pure Power Plant AutomaticWhite Label Pure Power Plant Auto cannabis seeds combine indica genetics (50%) with sativa and ruderalis (30% and 20% respectively). This popular strain was developed in the 1990s, and since then, has been a firm favourite with growers across the world. The balance of indica and sativa offers the benefits of both cannabis types; compact size and faster growth, combined with a more invigorating high. The plants are also 20% ruderalis, which makes them hardier and more robust. It’s an autoflowering strain, which makes it suitable for novice growers. The sturdy plants grow quickly: Expect flowering to start approximately three or four weeks from the time of germination, with the flowering period lasting around 45-55 days. The complete growth cycle is about 70 days from seed to harvest, which is ideal for those that want fast results. Some growers make the most of this rapid growth to enjoy multiple harvests each year. The indica genes of White Label’s Pure Power Plant Auto means that the plants are typically compact in size. In fact, most only grow to around 80 to 100 cm, which means they can be cultivated discreetly in a greenhouse or garden. Indoors, they’re usually even shorter, with an average height of around 50 to 70 cm. This is advantageous if space is limited. The plants are largely indica in structure too, with a ‘pine tree’ shape, and short internodal gaps. There doesn’t tend to be too much side-branching either. In terms of yield, growers can anticipate generating around 250 to 400 grams per square metre, or 120 to 180 grams when grown outside. When the buds start to develop, the sativa genetics become more apparent. Expect them to be covered in trichomes that are dense, sticky and plentiful. However, the buds are compact too (which is more typical of indica varieties).Pure Power Plant Automatic is a hardy, robust strain, and thrives well in most climates; even those with cooler, shorter summers. The plants need plenty of ventilation towards the end of the blooming stage, to avoid any issues with mould. Aside from this, they’re exceptionally easy to grow.

This strain is absolutely predestined for producing hashish, with a smell reminiscent of black finger hashish (charas) from India. Master Kush Automatic by White Label growth patternMaster Kush is one of the first cannabis strains created from two Kush strains. ‘Kush’ refers to the Hindu Kush mountains that extend from Afghanistan, across Pakistan and as far as India. It is the birthplace of cannabis indica, the branch of the cannabis family that’s known for its fast-flowering, dense buds and its resinous branches. Many indica varieties flourish even in mountainous regions and in extreme weather conditions. The considerable resin content of certain indica plants is why they are known as hashish plants – they are the source of the black finger hashish (charas) that is available across the entire Indian subcontinent. Master Kush Auto continues this heritage in a robust, compact seed strain. The plants begin to flower automatically after five to six weeks. Mature buds form in the finest indica fashion: they are dense, compact and heavy. They retain their size and weight after drying. Because this is a feminized strain that produces only female plants, there is no need to remove male shoots. The total cultivation period is short at an average of three months. Given good soil, and enough light and water, the seedlings flourish magnificently. Master Kush Automatic seeds enable even novices to grow premium-quality cannabis.Master Kush Automatic by White Label produces the majority of its yield from the main stem and the upper branches.

As an autoflowering strain, it requires minimum budget, minimum effort, and minimum gardening experience of any kind. Harvests are satisfying and swift. Along with Purple Bud Automatic, they’re White Label’s cheapest autoflowering strain. Growth pattern of White Skunk Automatic by White LabelLike the Regular and Feminized variants, White Skunk Automatic by White Label is 35% sativa and 65% indica. However, since it’s autoflowering, it thrives well outdoors in cold climates. This makes it an appealing choice for those living in countries with shorter, colder summers. White Skunk Auto’s growth structure is similar to the original, with a strong central stem and stubby lateral branches. Expect to see densely packed nodes, and relatively open buds. It’s a compact strain, which means it’s ideal for smaller gardens or growrooms with limited ceiling space. If growing in a pot, many experts advise transferring the small seedlings to larger containers. This is because White Skunk Automatic cannabis seeds are surprisingly fast-growing, which can catch gardeners by surprise. Large pots or free soil are both ideal, enabling the plant to reach its full potential size and yield. Although satisfying, the harvest may be less plentiful than the Regular and Feminized versions of this strain. This is typical of autoflowering cannabis plants. Novice growers (or those living in cold climates) accept this as a trade-off for the robust, easy-to-grow nature of the plants. More experienced growers living in warmer areas, or with indoor setups, might want to consider White Skunk Regular or White Skunk Feminized instead. Effect, taste, and smell of White Skunk Automatic by White LabelThis strain closely resembles the Regular and Feminized versions, in that it produces a distinctive citrus aroma, which some describe as being like bitter orange. This combines pleasantly with the earthy, skunky base-notes. The scent isn’t very strong during the cultivation stages, but becomes noticeably more potent after harvesting and curing. The buds are dominated by the smell of citrus, along with a hint of chocolate. These flavours are also detectable after consumption. As for the effect of White Skunk Auto? It’s less intense than other strains, which is ideal for those looking for cannabis that can be consumed in the morning or during the day. It’s also suitable for those who aren’t used to consuming it regularly. The indica genetics mean that this strain makes the user feel relaxed, while the sativa element stimulates and uplifts. This highly enjoyable combination is a hallmark of the skunk family, and is great for social or solo consumption. Did you know? White Skunk is an original White Label strainWhite Label also provides White Skunk Feminized and White Skunk Regular White Skunk Automatic is a perfect choice for skunk-lovers on a budget, and those with little gardening experience.</description><meta_title>White Skunk Automatic Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>White Skunk Automatic cannabis seeds are 35% sativa / 65% indica, and are cheap and easy to grow.

Descended from varieties bred to perform well in a harsh mountain environment, White Label Nicole Hindu Kush is a hardy, low-maintenance strain suitable for beginners and experts alike. It offers extremely high yields. Growth pattern of Nicole Hindu Kush by White LabelNicole Hindu Kush Feminized by White Label is 90% indica, 10% sativa. Moderate indica height gain in the blooming period means that indoor growers aiming for medium-to-large plants should give a longer vegetation period. This lets the plants reach about half their desired final size before inducing flowering.This feminized seed strain has a quick flowering period of seven to nine weeks. As blooming progresses, calyxes cluster thickly around its bracts and upper stem, forming solid buds. Like many indicas, the floral clusters of Nicole Hindu Kush tend to multiply at the nodes, rather than running along the branches. In later weeks, its calyxes take on a silvery sheen of resin glands. They swell and pile on top on of one another, forming large, hard buds. This flowering pattern means the compact White Label Nicole Hindu Kush feminized plants give a much greater yield than taller sativa-heavy hybrids.Mature Nicole Hindu Kush buds are dense and sticky, with the thick coating of resin glands characteristic of high-altitude cannabis indica strains. Buds are composed of large, rounded, tightly packed calyxes. These may display purple and blue hues toward the end of the blooming period. Taste, smell and effect of Nicole Hindu Kush Feminized by White LabelThis strain doesn’t produce much odour during cultivation, but the dried buds have a rich and complex aroma of sweet sandalwood, with notes of incense and lemongrass. The effect of Nicole Hindu Kush is most commonly described as relaxing, contemplative and euphoric. Above all else, most agree that it’s very powerful. Inexperienced consumers are advised to sample this strain in moderation, and even cannabis enthusiasts with a high tolerance for cannabinoids should handle it with care. This hybrid’s mostly-indica genetic background means that Nicole Hindu Kush tends to produce high levels of both THC and CBD.</description><meta_title>Nicole Hindu Kush Feminized White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Nicole Hindu Kush Feminized by White Label is 90% indica, 10% sativa.

Its parent plants are Strawberry Cough, a legendary Californian strain, and OG Kush, a celebrated indica. The strain is capable of producing generous yields, especially the taller phenotypes.Growth pattern of Strawberry Kush Feminized by White LabelWhite Label’s Strawberry Kush Feminized is 70% indica, 30% sativa. Although it’s indica-dominant, it displays many desirable sativa characteristics.Grown from seed, phenotype variation is mostly expressed through small differences in height gain and flowering time. Bud formation remains consistent across different phenotypes. Indoor plants have a flowering time of seven to ten weeks and usually triple their vegetated height as they bloom. Experienced growers of White Label Strawberry Kush feminized cannabis seeds tend to select the taller, longer flowering phenotypes for their higher yields.Originally, Strawberry Kush was only available in clone form. Many indoor growers of this seed- strain achieve optimum results by flowering cuttings of selected mother plants.Plants grown from seed may simply be flowered as normal and will produce good results as long as the extra height gain is taken into account. This makes Strawberry Kush Feminized cannabis seeds a good choice for cultivation in a greenhouse, or outdoors in a warm, sunny climate, where their sativa-influenced height gain is an advantage.Indoors, Strawberry Kush clones are well suited to ScrOG/SOG and super-cropping techniques. Taller phenotypes are also good for lollipopping, as they’ll produce most of their yield on the upper half of each plant. Upper branches tend to grow at a steep angle and often merge with the central cola. As such, removing the more expansive, less productive lower branches enables Strawberry Kush plants to be grown closer together.In the flowering stage, Strawberry Kush shows off the best of its indica and sativa heritage. Calyxes quickly form at each node, then cover the internodal gaps. The flower clusters eventually join together, forming large colas on the main stem and at the top of the branches. This Haze-style expansion is fortified by the density and resin production of Afghan indica (aka Kush).The end result is long, sparkling solid buds which retain a good proportion of their size and weight after harvest. Discreet growers should note that this strain’s characteristic aroma is often present in the flowering stage.Taste, smell and effect of Strawberry Kush Feminized by White LabelThe pistils of some prized Strawberry Kush phenotypes start out pink, and change to a deep red as the flowers mature. This gives the dried buds an exotic appearance to match their spectacular aroma.When properly harvested and cured, their mouth-watering strawberry scent and flavour becomes much more powerful. To some connoisseurs, the smell of Strawberry Kush buds is almost intoxicating by itself.While that unique flavour profile is one of the most recognisable and appealing features of White Label Strawberry Kush, don’t forget that this is a highly potent strain. With excellent resin production inherited from both its Haze and Kush parents, Strawberry Kush imparts a powerfully relaxing indica body-buzz that’s elevated and extended by a happy sativa high.</description><meta_title>Strawberry Kush Feminized Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Strawberry Kush Feminized by White Label is 70% indica, 30% sativa.

By returning the Gelato line to its Afghan and African cannabis roots, White Label Gelato #420 gains weight, flavour and even greater potency.Growth pattern of Gelato #420 Feminized by White LabelGelato #420 Feminized cannabis seeds are 60% indica, 40% sativa. Strong indica stature and significant sativa height gain are hallmarks of this strain. Indoors, it can be given a relatively short vegetation period, as plants generally triple their vegetated height as they flower. Outdoors, in a warm and sunny climate, Gelato #420 feminized cannabis seeds can be started a little later than other strains. This controls its height. When grown in a natural light cycle, certain cultivation techniques are useful for managing the strain’s impressive stature. These include training plants to grow parallel to the ground, trellising, and pruning them to encourage more bushy growth. As long as the local climate remains reasonably favourable through October, White Label Gelato #420 can produce an excellent outdoor harvest.Indoors, the best way to maximise the yield of Gelato #420 feminized cannabis seeds is cloning. Alternatively, prune the main stem of the larger plants to increase budding sites. Plants grown and flowered from seed tend to have strong lateral and upward branching, with very small internodal gaps. Naturally, clones share this trait, though their lateral branches tend to be less vigorous (due to the shorter vegetation time). The yield produced by Gelato #420’s branches means that lollipopping and SOG are best avoided. ScrOG (screen of green) can produce good results with well-spaced plants. At harvest time, Gelato #420’s abundance of budding nodes results in plants with long, thick colas on their main stems. The branches are also full of solid oval buds, which tend to stay separate. The density of these flower clusters means that even smaller buds retain a pleasing weight after drying. Flowering time is eight to eleven weeks, with the most efficient ratio of time vs yield coming from phenotypes in the nine to ten-week range.Effect, taste and smell of Gelato #420 Feminized by White LabelAfghan genes from OG Kush and Hindu Kush make deep purple hues quite common in Gelato #420’s mature buds. The resin production is outstanding, giving each calyx a beautiful frosting of golden trichomes. The growing odour is quite restrained, with the full, complex bouquet of this strain reaching its peak after drying. The most common elements are citrus, mint, and vanilla from the Kush hybrid forebears, plus aniseed, hashish, and sandalwood from the Durban and Hindu Kush cultivars. Uniting all these high notes is a base of smooth, creamy chamomile, most commonly associated with Haze strains. Gelato #420’s aroma profile may bring to mind all the flavours of an ice cream parlour.Highly potent indica and sativa parents make White Label Gelato #420 a strain that should never be taken lightly. A powerful euphoric body stone is lifted by an intense, creative sativa high. Novices should handle with care, and even experienced connoisseurs should test the waters before diving in.</description><meta_title>Gelato #420 Feminized Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Gelato #420 Feminized by White Label is 60% indica, 40% sativa.

This strain retains all these qualities, making it a solid option for novices. It’s also an ideal choice for more experienced growers who can bring it to its full, impressive potential. Growth pattern of Girl Scout Cookies by White LabelGSC Feminized cannabis seeds are 50% indica, 50% sativa. They produce uniform plants which flower in nine to ten weeks. This strain gains a good amount of height in flowering, improving its yield without becoming uncontrollable.Outdoor and greenhouse-grown plants can easily reach 200 or 250 cm by their October harvest time. Indoors, cuttings can be flowered at around 30-40 cm to attain a final height of 100 cm. Flowering original seed plants at the same height is likely to result in plants reaching 125 cm by harvest time. White Label Girl Scout Cookies feminized cannabis seeds grow into plants with strong, productive branching. Branches tend to grow upwards rather than outwards, allowing indoor plants to be grown quite close together.The flowering patterns of White Label GSC show strong influences from its indica and sativa genetics. Calyxes multiply rapidly and swell in size, forming strings which twist around each other to create spiky floral clusters. These continue expanding throughout the second half of flowering, running along the stem and branches to close the gaps between internodes. Finally, they form long, sticky colas with a gorgeous bubbly appearance. Thanks to its Afghan heritage, Girl Scout Cookies often takes on violet hues in the later flowering period. These come through in the dark purple leaves and lavender highlights on the base of calyxes. At harvest time and after drying, the buds of this strain display a combination of purple and green foliage, bright orange pistils, and sparkling white-golden resin glands. It’s a visual treat that complements their potency and flavour.Effect, taste and smell of Girl Scout Cookies by White LabelAfter harvest, White Label Girl Scout Cookies’ flowers remain impressively large, due to the fat calyxes from which they’re formed. Even when dry, GSC’s thick coating of trichomes makes buds sticky to the touch. Growers should be aware that they can easily gum up scissors and grinders with THC-rich resin.This strain’s aroma is subtle until the flower clusters are broken up, releasing their terpenes. Dominant flavours include pine, sandalwood, and rich earth, with a background of fruit, citrus, mint, and aniseed.The potent Kush background and higher CBD production of Girl Scout Cookies makes it a popular strain in US dispensaries. Many users have reported welcome effects such as pain relief, appetite stimulation, and reduced nausea.

There are also some all-time greats from Sensi Seeds - Hindu Kush, Big Bud, and – influencing both sides of the family – Durban, the potent South African sativa. Wedding Cheesecake feminized cannabis seeds by White Label display desirable traits from five generations of breeding. These include the complex flavour profile, unbelievable resin production, and huge buds on a sturdy, compact, fast-flowering frame. Growth pattern of Wedding Cheesecake Feminized by White LabelWedding Cheesecake feminized cannabis seeds are 70% indica, 30% sativa. They grow well in a greenhouse, or outdoors in a warm, sunny climate. However, indoors under lights is where the plants truly flourish. As a fast, low-maintenance strain, Wedding Cheesecake can be cultivated even by novice growers. The most important factors for this variety are bright light and low humidity, which maximise its flowering potential. Growers should also bear in mind that this strain can produce an increasing odour from the very onset of flowering, so a good air filter system is important.Pruning branches completely to allow close spacing (AKA lollipopping) is not advised. However, close spacing and good yield can be achieved by flowering small clones in the Sea of Green (SOG) method. Pruning/topping the main stems of larger plants may increase budding sites and overall yield. Wedding Cheesecake typically doubles in size as it flowers, with some plants adding 150% to their vegetated height. Rare examples may triple their height in the blooming phase.White Label Wedding Cheesecake flowers quickly and vigorously, forming massive, weighty colas on the upper half of its main stem and branches. Smaller, yet equally dense, resinous flower-clusters fill the lower nodes, leaving little unoccupied space on the plants’ compact frames. Calyxes are medium-sized, highly resinous orbs, with long pistils that sometimes turn pink, rather than orange, as they mature. The combination of large buds (made up of mid-sized calyxes with profuse trichomes) and long pistils give the main colas of Wedding Cheesecake a unique appearance - fuzzy and sparkling at the same time.Taste, smell and effect of Wedding Cheesecake Feminized by White LabelAfter harvest, dried buds remain large, solid, and sticky with resin. When broken up (or even handled vigorously), they fill the air with the awesome terpene profile inherited from Wedding Cheesecake’s pedigree lineage. The strongest element is inherited from Cheese – a fantastically pungent Skunk with strong, sweet berry overtones. This is accompanied by sharper citrus, plus earthy and woody notes from other illustrious forebears.It goes without saying that White Label Wedding Cheesecake has an extremely powerful effect, and should be handled with care even by more experienced smokers. On first encounter, it’s advisable to inhale one or two moderate test puffs, then wait a short while to see how strong the effects are. At any dose this strain’s high is typically warm, positive and uplifting. At medium to high doses, effects can range from heavy, contemplative, full-body relaxation, to sky-high, talkative, creative, and even psychedelic experiences.</description><meta_title>Wedding Cheesecake Feminized White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Wedding Cheesecake Feminized by White Label is 70% indica, 30% sativa.

These include the legendary Silver Haze crossed with Skunk Kush, and the famously flavourful, mostly-sativa NYC Diesel. Strains of Afghan Kush are also present on both sides of the family tree. Skunk Kush forms an important building block on the paternal side, while the pride of Californian cannabis, OG Kush, is the mother plant used to make White Label Banana Kush.Growth pattern of Banana Kush Feminized Seeds by White LabelBanana Kush Feminized cannabis seeds are 70% indica, 30% sativa, and they display typical indica growth patterns. This strain’s sativa influence is mostly seen in its flower structure and in the resulting high. Vegetative growth is vigorous and reliable. Most plants develop a thick, productive main stem, and sturdy branches with short internodal gaps. During the blooming phase, Banana Kush Feminized typically increases its vegetated height by 100% to 150%. Banana Kush slows its upward growth in the first weeks of flowering as the first calyxes develop at its many budding sites. Before the midpoint of its seven to nine week flowering time, this strain will produce several small, solid, resinous calyxes at each node. These quickly build into thick knots of bud. Flower clusters often take on a conical or pyramidal shape, with an extra wide base tapering to a blunt point. Due to the extra vigorous budding, the terminal buds at the top of Banana Kush’s main stem and branches often join with the flower clusters below them, forming large colas. This occurs despite the calyxes’ tendency to cluster at nodes, rather than ‘run’ between them.In the flowering phase, White Label Banana Kush is remarkably low-maintenance, and plants can mostly be left to their own devices until harvest time. Humidity should be kept low in the second half of flowering, due to the size and tight formation of the buds. Like many heavy indica strains Banana Kush need plenty of nutrients to produce optimum results. With the right level of care, the plants tend to produce bumper harvests. After harvest, buds typically dry quickly, while retaining much of their size. For larger harvests a dehumidifier or good air circulation is recommended in the drying area, as Banana Kush buds can release a large amount of water into the air. Manicuring is also a simple task, as plants produce minimal foliage in the flowering phase. Even the large flower clusters have relatively few single-bladed leaves growing from them.Effect, taste, and smell of Banana Kush Feminized by White LabelWhite Label Banana Kush is indica-dominant. The buds are fat, fruity and fragrant, and sticky with resin glands. They’re also easy to crumble, due to their comparatively small calyxes. Breaking buds up releases the full, complex aroma of this variety. Expect to smell and taste sweet, ripe banana, brown sugar, citrus, and rich, spicy hash. While it’s growing the odour is not overpowering. However, growers should take note that it is likely to increase as harvest approaches.The effects are mostly indica, but there’s enough sativa to elevate its powerful body-high and make it stand out from other Kush strains. Banana Kush’s warm, relaxing euphoric effect is felt almost immediately. The Haze part of its cannabinoid profile takes effect shortly afterwards, lifting the high and making it more conducive to conversation, laughter and creativity.</description><meta_title>Banana Kush Feminized Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Banana Kush Feminized by White Label is 70% indica, 30% sativa.

This reinforced the superb resin production and cannabinoid content. Meanwhile, a fruity f2 Banana Kush was bred with Sensi Seeds’ citrussy California Indica to produce a hybrid with outstanding aroma, flavour and potency. A special breeding programme combined them into a new stable strain, featuring all their desirable qualities - Double Banana Kush.Growth pattern of Double Banana Kush FeminizedDouble Banana Kush Feminized is 95% indica. Its growth pattern reflects this – tough, compact and fast. It’s also enhanced by the hybrid vigour which the new genetic material of California Indica brings to the mix. This strain can be grown in a bright greenhouse or even outdoors in a hot, sunny climate to increase the yield. The most potent, resinous examples of Double Banana Kush are almost always seen in crops grown indoors, under lights.Original seed plants of Double Banana Kush may gain 150% of their pre-flowered height as they bloom. Clones, on the other hand, usually double their vegetated height in the flowering stage. Most phenotypes of Double Banana Kush have less vigorous branching than Banana Kush. This is especially the case when flowered at small or medium sizes. This strain is ideal for Sea of Green (SOG), lollipopping, and supercropping methods due to its fast flowering, compact stature, and good production on its main stem and upper branches. Phenotypes with strong lateral branching similar to the Banana Kush parent plants also perform well with the Screen of Green (ScrOG) technique.In flowering Double Banana Kush performs similarly to Banana Kush, though with noticeably more ‘run’ between nodes in the later stages of its seven to ten-week blooming phase. Flowering plants cease upward growth early in the blooming phase, instead producing large, conical flower clusters which burst out at every node and bract before expanding along the main stem and upper branches. Some phenotypes of Double Banana Kush initially produce small calyxes. These swell magnificently in the final weeks, significantly increasing the volume and weight of their buds. Small or large, the density of the resin glands covering the calyxes of Double Banana Kush must be seen to be believed. By harvest time, this strain’s dark green foliage is smothered by a thick layer of sparkling trichomes. This gives plants a frosted appearance that may even seem iridescent due to the light-refracting properties of the resin glands. Mature trichomes of White Label Double Banana Kush often change colour from clear to golden, rather than amber. Harvests are usually generous, especially with the right level of care and attention. Effect, taste, and smell of Double Banana Kush FeminizedDespite having less growing odour than its Banana Kush parent, the aroma of dried Double Banana Kush is even more complex and mouth-watering. Strong banana and orange scents are the basis of its bouquet, with notes of berry, passionfruit, and even melon. There’s also a sharp undercurrent of dark chocolate from its Afghan indica ancestors.When consumed, Double Banana Kush by White Label may be the ultimate strain for relaxing at home, whether solo or with friends. The term ‘couchlock’ is not quite accurate here, as it’s usually not incapacitating unless overindulged. This is a strain for getting comfortable on the sofa, rather than simply being unable to get up. Double Banana Kush has a blissful, thought-provoking, supremely powerful indica effect which enhances food, music and conversation. It’s the perfect strain for any activity which can take place while relaxing – movies, music, gaming, eating, reading – the possibilities are endless.</description><meta_title>Double Banana Kush Feminized by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Double Banana Kush Feminized by White Label is 95% indica.

They grow well in a greenhouse, or outdoors in a Mediterranean climate, as long as they have daily access to direct sunlight. Growing outdoors allows this hybrid to reach its full size, and greatly increases the yield. Guava Jelly is a vigorous strain and can thrive in favourable outdoor conditions. However, it may require support from stakes or a trellis, as its slender branches may be weighed down by buds at the end of the summer. The height of Guava Jelly can be controlled indoors by flowering the plants when they’re small. As this strain generally triples its height in the flowering stage, clones can be put into flower at 20 cm to 30 cm, to achieve a final height that’s under 100 cm. The strain’s tendency to produce branches that grow upwards rather than outwards makes it suitable for the Sea of Green (SOG) training method. The original Guava Jelly seed plants often benefit from a longer vegetation time. Their height and structure can be optimised for indoor grow-spaces by pruning plants to create multiple stems (AKA topping). Supercropping or the Screen of Green (ScrOG) method are also effective.The bud structure of Guava Jelly’s best phenotypes takes the form of fat calyxes, which explode in clusters and grow atop one another in strings. These ropes of calyxes entwine at each node, forming large knots of bud with multiple tips growing in every direction. During flowering they also expand to cover the internodal gaps, filling Guava Jelly’s stem and branches by harvest time. Bud density is greatest at the nodes and bracts, where Guava Jelly’s oversized calyxes almost fight for space. The ropes of calyxes run between the flower clusters, joining them up to form colas that have a quite open structure, without being feathery or underweight. Due to their thick covering of resin glands, even single strands of calyxes become brittle, sticky shards of bud when dried. Smell, taste and effect of Guava Jelly by White LabelGuava Jelly tends to have low growing odour. This variety’s full, fruity bouquet is only released after buds are harvested, dried and broken up. Guava is just one of the fruits in its terpene profile. A deep inhalation will also reveal berry notes from Strawberry Kush, aniseed and citrus from Durban, and a sweet, skunky undercurrent from Wedding Cheesecake.White Label Guava Jelly imparts a powerful high from both its indica and sativa background. Most users report a warm, positive body feeling at first, drawn from its Kush and Skunk ancestry. This effect is enhanced by the uplifting, energetic, electric high of Guava Jelly’s sativa side. Many connoisseurs get so absorbed in the initial happy indica ‘stone’ that they don’t realise how high they are until they try to stand up.</description><meta_title>Guava Jelly Feminized Seeds by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Guava Jelly by White Label is 50/50 indica and sativa.

Both Silver Haze and Amnesia Haze are strains noted for their high THC content, and Gorilla Glue has an extraordinary coating of cannabinoid-rich resin glands.White Label White Gorilla Haze inherits its uplifting high from the Haze side of its ancestry, and its frosting of trichomes from all its parents, especially Gorilla Glue. Resin glands cover the buds of White Gorilla Haze, as well as the single-bladed leaves growing from flower clusters, the stems below those clusters, and even some fan leaves and branches.Growth pattern of White Gorilla Haze Feminized by White LabelWhite Gorilla Haze Feminized cannabis seeds are 35% indica, 65% sativa. In the hands of experienced natural-light cultivators, they can be grown in a greenhouse. Outside, in a Mediterranean climate, the plants can produce huge yields, as long as the local climate remains sunny throughout October. Large White Gorilla Haze plants grown in natural light may need support from a trellis or stake, as their flower production can become too heavy for their slender branches. Indoors is where White Gorilla Haze feminized cannabis seeds most easily reach their full potential of yield and resin production. This mostly-sativa strain has a low growing odour and will usually add 200 or even 300% to its vegetated height as it blooms. This means that seed plants and clones can be put into flower at 30 cm or less, to reach a final height of around 100 cm. SOG, ScrOG and lollipopping are all suitable methods for maximising the yield of White Gorilla Haze. The longest-flowering phenotypes also perform well indoors at larger sizes. This is because their high flower-to-foliage ratio enables grow-lights to illuminate the whole plant without much shading from the leaves.The flowering pattern of White Gorilla Haze is a joy to behold, as it expresses both its indica and sativa genetics. Resin production begins early, while calyxes are still appearing in pairs at each node. It then greatly accelerates as the buds expand along the branches and main stem.The fastest flowering phenotypes of White Gorilla Haze have the most solid flower clusters and the least internodal expansion. The buds of medium- and long-flowering plants usually ‘run’ along stem and branches as their calyxes swell in size. This closes the gaps and creates huge colas.All phenotypes of White Gorilla Haze display this strain’s outstanding resin production. Harvested buds remain sticky to touch even when dried and cured. Like its Gorilla Glue parent, breaking up the flower clusters of White Gorilla Haze by hand can leave fingers almost glued together by resin. It may even gum up scissors and grinders! Taste, smell and effect of White Gorilla Haze Feminized by White LabelThe flavour profile of White Gorilla Haze Feminized, which remains subtle throughout cultivation and drying, is released when buds are broken up. Growers can expect a sharp Haze undercurrent, with notes of coffee, pine and citrus.The all-over covering of THC-rich trichomes means that the buds are extremely potent. When first encountering this strain, even advanced smokers are advised to test a smaller sample than they would normally consume. This hybrid has an intense, sky-high sativa effect, ranging from dreamy and creative, to almost psychedelic. While it has enough indica to keep the user grounded, this is an energetic smoke that is more suited to (careful) daytime use than as a night-cap. When accustomed to its potency, White Gorilla Haze by White Label is an ideal choice for vaporizing, as gentle heating makes the most of its copious resin glands. It’s possible to generate a surprising amount of vapour from the smallest buds, and even from its manicured leaves.</description><meta_title>White Gorilla Haze Feminized by White Label – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>White Gorilla Haze Feminized by White Label is 65% sativa, 35% indica.

It’s a 70% indica, 30% sativa strain, which is evident in the plants’ relatively speedy flowering period, and yet citrussy aroma and taste. Thanks to the qualities of its parent plants, growers can expect bountiful yields, with plenty of sticky, resinous buds. The high is naturally also worthy of mention – intense, uplifting and deeply relaxing. It’s very much an American-style cannabis strain.Growth pattern of Banana Frosting FeminizedThis hybrid’s impressive genetic pool includes parent plants like Silver Haze, Skunk Kush and Hindu Kush. The sativa influence is largely thanks to Silver Haze, and results in a noticeable sense of euphoria when consumed. However, the indica influence of the Kush parentage is evident in the plentiful buds and large yields, and Diesel can be detected in the aroma and cerebral high. These seeds are feminized, which means that it’s highly unlikely that the pack will contain any male plants. This is an advantage for novice growers, as it means there probably won’t be any requirement to identify and remove certain plants during cultivation. Another benefit of this strain is its relatively short flowering time of just 50 to 65 days, which is useful for those who want to harvest the plants fairly quickly. Despite the fact that it’s mostly sativa, the strain doesn’t grow to excessive heights. In fact, it’s a fairly compact variety and can be grown discreetly, both indoors and outside. In appearance, the strain is sturdy and bushy, which is reminiscent of its indica background. The main stem is thick and strong, and has branches with short internodes. Growers can expect to see plenty of buds forming during the flowering stages, which usually result in a bumper harvest. The colas are large and dense, and are pyramidal in shape. One of this strain’s biggest draws is its extensive yields. When cultivated outdoors in the right conditions, growers are likely to generate a sizeable quantity. The plants also perform well indoors. If growing the plants outside, the climate should be warm and sunny, with a long, reliable summer. Mediterranean countries are perfect. The plants respond well to most cultivation techniques, such as SCROG (Screen of Green), SOG (Sea of Green), supercropping, and lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Banana Frosting FeminizedThe strain is 70% indica and 30% sativa, and most users note that the sativa is predominant in the scent, taste, and to a degree, in the high.Unsurprisingly (given its parentage), the strain produces an effect that’s intense and fast-acting. Users can anticipate physical relaxation without a couch-lock, and a sense of warmth and happiness. The sativa genetics add a feeling of euphoria too, and just the right level of uplift. When the plants are growing, they have a sweet, ripe banana and citrus aroma, which strengthens as the flowering period progresses. Other fruity scents may also be detected, particularly near the harvesting stage. When tasted, users note that citrus is the dominant flavour with a novel banana finish, but there’s also a hint of spice and brown sugar too. This fruity sweetness reveals Banana Frosting’s Californian side.In a nutshell This strain is a relatively compact plant and can be grown discreetly.It produces a pleasant sweet banana and citrus aroma and taste.

Its impressive parentage includes Durban, a world-famous sativa; Gelato, which is known for its intense high; and Hindu Kush, a celebrated producer of impressive yields. Gelato is a very special cultivar, and provides an exciting group of genetics for us to work with. Its parents are two top quality strains from the Girl Scout Cookies family tree. Gelato originated in California’s Bay Area, and with its unmistakable dessert aroma has become one of today’s most famous varieties. We’re delighted to bring you our Sensi Seeds version of Gelato, which has all the Californian personality of the original, reinforced with Sensi Seeds genetics.The plants take a little longer than average to complete their flowering period. During this time, they grow to sizeable heights. They produce a citrussy, sandalwood aroma, with notes of hash. The high is the real draw – users can anticipate a rush of euphoria and creativity combined with a potent body-stone. Growth pattern of Buttercream Gelato FeminizedThese seeds are feminized. That means that all the plants they produce will flower as though they are female. Novice growers find that this is an advantage, as they don’t need to identify and remove male plants during cultivation. The plants have a relatively lengthy flowering time of around 55 to 75 days. However, most growers agree that the resulting buds are well worth the wait. Although this is an indica-dominant strain, growers can expect the plants to grow to fairly large heights, especially when cultivated outside. Despite this height, the indica influence is evident in the appearance of the plants. They feature strong lateral branching. During the flowering stages, the branches become laden with weighty buds. The long, thick colas form on the central stem and branches, and have lots of sticky resin. When grown outside in the right conditions, the plants will produce good-sized yields. They’re also suitable for indoor cultivation. Outdoors, the best climate is Mediterranean: warm, sunny and with a long, reliable summer. Experienced growers may want to experiment with the SCROG (Screen of Green) cultivation technique, or supercropping. Both reportedly produce good results. Effect, taste, and smell of Buttercream Gelato FeminizedThe influence of this strain’s Gelato parentage is evident in the aroma, taste and high. Gelato is descended from the Cookie family of cannabis cultivars, which is known for sweet, fruity, dessert flavours. Combining this with the earthy notes of Hindu Kush and the subtle spice of Durban has created a delicious blend.Upon consumption, users will notice the swift-acting body-stone, which provides a potent sense of relaxation. While this is typical of indica- dominant varieties, the sativa is apparent in the accompanying uplifting high, which often leaves users feeling chatty and creative. During the flowering period, the plants produce a subtle citrus aroma, with notes of sandalwood, mint and vanilla. There’s also a distinct hint of hash, which strengthens as the buds approach harvest-time. The subtlety of the smell makes this a good strain for discreet cultivation. To taste, users can expect a full, rich flavour, with a creamy, fruity aftertaste. In a nutshell Although this is an indica-dominant strain, the plants are usually tall (which is typically associated with sativa varieties) which increases yield. Parent strain Gelato is part of the Cookie family, sweet and powerful! Two other parents, Hindu Kush and Durban, are among the most celebrated strains in the world. The high is a blend of indica and sativa; powerfully relaxing but also uplifting.</description><meta_title>Buttercream Gelato Feminized Seeds - Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Buttercream Gelato is 60% indica and 40% sativa, combining Gelato, Durban and Hindu Kush genetics.

Growers looking for a strain they can grow discreetly will no doubt regard this as an advantage. The plants are sturdy, short and bushy, with a thick central stem and lots of branches. Plenty of buds form during the flowering stage, and these are usually large and weighty in appearance. When cultivated in the right conditions, growers can anticipate extensive yields, both indoors and out. The ideal climate for this strain is Mediterranean, or any country that offers a long, warm summer with plenty of sunlight. Most cultivation techniques work well with this strain, such as SCROG (Screen of Green), SOG (Sea of Green) and supercropping.

It’s 90% indica, 10% sativa, and the indica dominance comes out in the intense, relaxing stone. Like many indicas, the plants are compact with a fairly speedy flowering time. They also generate impressive yields. Growers can expect an earthy aroma and taste, along with hints of berry and pine. Nicole Kush can be defined as a sweet and woody flavoured strain with notes of lemon that captures the dynamism and freshness of the US fields.Growth pattern of N13 Kush Feminized This strain, developed by Sensi Seeds’ researchers, has an impressive parentage. Its genetic pool includes plants like Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant (named after cannabis icon Howard Marks), and Nicole Kush – both varieties having won awards in the past.It’s a 90% indica, 10% sativa strain, and the strong indica genetics can be seen in the plant’s appearance and the relaxing, powerful high. The seeds are feminized, to avoid the presence of male plants. This makes it easier for novice growers, as there’s no requirement to identify and remove unwanted plants. The strain also has a relatively short flowering time of 50 to 65 days, so the buds can be harvested fairly quickly. Like most indica-dominant strains, the plants remain compact, both indoors and out. That means they can be grown without detection with relative ease. They’re also typically indica in appearance, with a thick central cola and plenty of bushy branches. The buds usually multiply at the nodes rather than on the branches themselves, which is another classic feature of an indica-dominant strain. When cultivated in the right conditions, the plants produce plenty of weighty, resinous buds, which result in a formidable harvest. It’s largely the bumper yields that make this cannabis strain a popular choice for growers. The characteristics from Nicole Kush usually produce sizeable harvests, regardless of whether it’s grown indoors or outside. However, if growing this strain outdoors, it’s important to note that they require a continental climate, with plenty of warmth and sunlight. Most cultivation techniques deliver good results with this strain, such as SCROG (Screen of Green), SOG (Sea of Green), lollipopping and supercropping. Effect, taste, and smell of N13 Kush Feminized This strain is 90% indica and 10% sativa. As a result, the aroma, taste and effect are all very indica in personality, though a hint of the sativa influence can be detected. When consumed, users report a fast-acting sense of deep relaxation and warmth, which leaves them feeling both thoughtful and inspired. During the cultivation stage, the plants produce a pleasant earthy scent, with hints of rich berry and pine. This aroma intensifies as harvest-time approaches, and during the curing process. The taste is a perfect balance between the sweet flavours of Nicole Kush and the popular hashy one of Mr Nice G13 x Hash Plant, with notes of berry still very evident. N13 Kush brings together the best of US and Sensi Seeds genetics.In a nutshell Like most indica-dominant strains, the plants are compact and can be cultivated without drawing much attention.

Kush mixed with other cultivars has created many of the most popular contemporary cannabis strains. Double Kush Cake contains all the best traits of our many Kush cultivars, and is the Sensi Seeds tribute to our Kush dynasty. The sweet, dank flavours and relaxing effects bring the US Kush experience home.This strain is 70% indica, 10% sativa, and 20% ruderalis. It’s a feminized autoflowering variant, which makes it easy to cultivate, even for beginners. Its impressive genetic pool includes Hindu Kush Auto, Skunk Kush, and Afghani #1, and it produces an effect that’s pleasantly relaxing, with a real indica buzz. The scent is pleasantly earthy, sweet and skunky, and the plants can be grown discreetly, thanks to their compact size. Growth pattern of Double Kush Cake Automatic This hybrid strain has a prodigious parentage, with a genetic pool that includes Afghani #1, Skunk Kush, and Hindu Kush Automatic. The ruderalis influence ensures that the plants are hardy, and can be grown in a variety of climates, and the indica-dominance is evident in the scent and the high. It’s a 70% indica, 10% sativa and 20% ruderalis strain, and is feminized and autoflowering. This means that the seeds produce plants which will grow and flower as though they are female, and will begin flowering automatically. This gives the advantages that the flowering times are predictable, and there is no need to change the lighting cycles if growing indoors. As such, it’s a good choice for those with limited cultivation experience. Thanks to the ruderalis genes, the strain has a short flowering time of just 7 to 9 weeks (49 to 63 days). This is very swift, enabling growers to enjoy a harvest without waiting too long. The indica parentage ensures that the plants remain compact, even at full height. This makes them suitable for discreet growing, both indoors and out. Like many indica-dominant strains, the plants are short, sturdy and bushy, with a thick central cola. The buds are usually big and dense, and coated in a layer of resin. Although this is an auto strain, the harvests are still fairly sizeable. Growers have reported generating around 350-450 grams/m2. The plants are also hardy, and thrive in even cooler, more temperate climates. Alternatively, they can be cultivated indoors all year round. More experienced growers may want to experiment with the SOG (Sea of Green) or lollipopping techniques to boost the yield further. Effect, taste, and smell of Double Kush Cake Automatic This strain is 70% indica, and its genetics are strongly evident in the aroma, taste and effect. Upon consumption, users note the pleasantly stoned, relaxed sensation, combined with a typically indica buzz. The scent is also very indica in nature: earthy, dank and with a hint of sweetness. The aroma intensifies as the plants grow, and is even richer when the buds are being cured. In terms of flavour, users can anticipate notes of molasses and hash.

Its parent plants include White Widow, Maple Leaf Indica, NYC Diesel, and Hindu Kush; strains that are highly regarded throughout the world. It’s 60% indica, 20% sativa, and 20% ruderalis. The indica dominance is evident in the appearance of the plants, which are short and sturdy, and the stone, which is a potent couch-lock. However, the sativa influence can also be felt in the sense of euphoria and happiness. The seeds are feminized and auto-flowering, which means that they’re easy to grow, even for complete beginners. The plants have a flowering time of 9 weeks (63 days), and are compact in size, even when they reach full maturity. This is advantageous for growers who want to cultivate them discreetly, either indoors or outside. Visually, they resemble other indica-dominant varieties, with a thick central stem and plenty of bushy branches. The buds usually form around the central cola, rather than on the branches themselves. Growers can expect to generate a relatively good-sized yield, especially given that this is an autoflowering strain. One of the main benefits of an automatic is its ability to thrive in most climates, and this strain is no exception. The plants are likely to grow well in the majority of locations, even in countries with cooler, shorter summers. They can respond well to most popular cultivation techniques, like SOG (Sea of Green), supercropping and lollipopping, once growers have gained a little experience.

Hawaiian Indica is an unusual strain in that most varieties from this area are more sativa in nature, but this exclusive Sensi Seeds cultivar combines exotic flavours of pineapple and tropical fruit with gentle indica relaxation.It’s 50% sativa, 20% indica, and 30% ruderalis, and the sativa dominance is evident in the high, which is cerebral and euphoric. As an automatic feminized strain, it’s easy to cultivate in most climates, even for complete beginners. The plants produce a tangy, fruity aroma and taste, and grow to moderate heights. Growth pattern of Sensi Amnesia Automatic This strain has three notable parent plants in its genetic pool: Jamaican Pearl, Afghani #1, and Hawaiian Indica. Jamaican Pearl is an award-winning sativa, and its influence is strongly evident in the high, which is chatty and cerebral. Along with being 50% sativa, the strain is also 20% indica and 30% ruderalis. It’s a feminized variant, which means that the seeds will grow into plants that grow and flower as females. As such, growers don’t need to worry about removing unwanted male plants to boost their harvest. It’s also autoflowering, which is a major advantage for those wanting to grow the plants in cooler climates. Simply put, this strain typically thrives in most locations, both indoors and out. The strain has a relatively long flowering time of 10 to 12 weeks (70 to 84 days). However, the advantage of being autoflowering makes it easier to cultivate. The plants can reach moderate heights, which is unusual for an automatic variant. Growers can expect to see them reach 120 cm when cultivated indoors, and up to 210 cm when grown outside. In appearance, the plants take on a conical shape, with a slender top and a heavier, bushier base. The buds are quite compact, and tend to form along the central stem and at the end of the lateral branches. When cared for properly, the plants will produce moderately good yields for an auto. While the harvests might not be as prodigious as other strains, the ease-of-growing more than makes up for it. Unlike many variants, this strain grows well even in cooler climates with shorter summers, and doesn’t require much maintenance. The SCROG (Screen of Green) and SOG (Sea of Green) cultivation techniques can be applied to it by more experienced growers, as can lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Sensi Amnesia AutomaticThe 50% sativa genetics of this strain really come through in the high, which is uplifting, awakening, and cerebral. There’s also a hint of relaxation, thanks to the 20% indica influence. The aroma is similarly sativa in personality. Growers can expect their plants to produce a sharp, tropical scent, with notes of exotic fruit and citrus. This smell usually gets stronger as the plants approach harvest-time, and the flavours also carry through to the taste. Some users also report that the taste is similar to the Haze family.

This means that they’ll grow and flower like females, while their growth and flowering cycles aren’t affected by the amount of hours of light they get. The result? A strain that’s really easy to cultivate, even for beginners. The flowering period is 60 to 70 days, which is about average. Likewise, the plants tend to grow to average heights, and usually end up around 100 cm tall. This is thanks to the indica parentage, and means that they can be cultivated discreetly, both inside and outdoors. The plants are bushy and compact in appearance, with plenty of lateral branches. The buds are long and thick, and are generally quite plentiful by harvest-time. Though this is an autoflowering variant, the yields are still impressive. It’s not uncommon for growers to obtain around 450 g per square metre. Black Lights CBD Automatic produces robust plants, which are able to withstand even cold climates. They can also be cultivated indoors at any time of the year. Experienced growers can have success with cultivation techniques such as SOG (Sea of Green) and lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Black Lights CBD Automatic The strain is a blend of indica, sativa and ruderalis. The two main parent plants, Black Harlequin and the legendary Northern Lights #5, can be detected in the relaxing high, juicy scent, and fruity taste. Upon consumption, users often report a deeply relaxing, typically indica stone, followed by a welcome uplifting sensation. With THC levels of 12% to 15%, the relaxing effects of Black Lights CBD are pleasantly intense, without resulting in a total couch-lock. While the plants are growing, they produce a sweet, fruity aroma, which is fairly subtle. Again, this is beneficial for those wishing to cultivate the strain without attracting attention. The taste is similar to the smell, though the sweetness from the Black Harlequin parent really comes into the foreground, giving it a mouth-watering flavour.

The strain contains extremely low levels of THC, and users report an intoxicating relaxation, without any noticeable psychoactive effects. The stone is calming for the body and mind, and the yields are usually huge. Growers enjoy the pleasantly floral, spicy aroma, and the potent diesel taste, which has hints of ginger. This strain grows well outdoors in Mediterranean climates, and indoors everywhere. One of the most famous Sensi Seeds strains, Skunk #1 was originally born in the US. Obviously, we could not leave it out of the CBD family and so we’re proud to present the CBD version of our beloved Skunk #1 in a strictly non-psychoactive form. Now everyone, even those who don’t want to become high, can enjoy the unmistakable taste of the original Skunk #1, and become a devoted fan of the mother of all the new cannabis trends in the last 35 years. Skunk Dream CBD is the perfect expression of the American potential of Sensi Seeds Skunk #1, blended with the full-body relaxation and calming elements of high CBD concentrations.Growth pattern of Skunk Dream CBD FeminizedSkunk Dream CBD Feminized is sativa dominant (70% to 30% indica). It’s got a THC to CBD ratio of 1:26, and incredibly low levels of THC (just 0.25%). The CBD content is around 7%. As such, it’s a strain that may appeal to those looking for a relaxing effect, without any psychoactive impact.This is a feminized cannabis seed variety, and as such will not produce any male plants, only feminized ones. This makes cultivation easier for inexperienced growers. The plants have an average flowering time of around 70 to 75 days, which means they’re usually harvested in October if grown outdoors. It should be noted that they can grow to tall heights, so should be planted in an environment with plenty of space. A major draw of Skunk Dream CBD Feminized is the generous yields. When cultivated indoors, growers can obtain up to 550 to 600 g per square metre. Outside, if given unlimited root space, the harvest can reach 800 g per plant.Thanks to the sativa dominance, the plants are not only tall, but also typically sativa in appearance. They have a ‘stretched out’, somewhat aerated structure, and form plenty of fluffy buds during the flowering stage.This strain flourishes in locations with warm, sunny summers, such as the Mediterranean. It’s also naturally pest-resistant, which is advantageous for novice gardeners. Alternatively, the plants can be cultivated inside, but will need room to reach their full potential height. Experienced growers may want to experiment with the SCROG (Screen of Green) or supercropping techniques when cultivating. Effect, taste, and smell of Skunk Dream CBD Feminized Skunk Dream CBD Feminized is 70% sativa and 30% indica. However, what’s notable about this strain’s high is that, even though one of its parents is the powerful, high-energy Skunk #1, it doesn’t produce any psychoactive effects. The low THC levels mean that (with the right preparation) it’s legal to grow in some countries, such as Switzerland. The CBD definitely makes itself known upon consumption, with users reporting a pleasant sense of relaxation, both in the body and mind. The lack of psychoactive effect in no way compromises the typical skunkiness and earthy notes in the flavour and scent of Skunk #1. The plants produce a spicy, floral aroma while they’re growing, and this becomes stronger as the buds approach harvest-time. The taste echoes this spicy smell, and also has notes of diesel and ginger.

Prized around the world for its bumper harvests, this strain is robust, easy to grow, and has natural mould and pest resistance. It also has a deliciously sweet, fruity aroma, and a taste that’s similar to molasses. Thanks to its indica-dominant genetics, users can expect a potent, relaxing stone. Growth pattern of Big Bud FeminizedBig Bud Feminized cannabis seeds are 85% indica. This is detectable in the plant’s structure and yield, as well as its intense, relaxing high. Sensi Seeds took the original Big Bud (which dates back to the 1980s), and added Skunk #1 and Northern Lights into its genetic make-up. This results in a plant that’s robust, skunky and capable of impressive harvests.This is the feminized version of the strain. That means that the seeds are highly unlikely to produce any male plants, which makes cultivation much easier. Big Bud has a comparatively short flowering time (of around 50 to 65 days), which makes it a good option for those that like quick results. When grown outdoors, the best harvesting time is mid- to late October. Big Bud Feminized won’t grow to towering heights indoors. In fact, depending on the environment, their growth can be limited to just 50 - 100cm. Outside, however, it’s another matter: When the plants reach maturity, they may be as tall as 200 to 225 cm. Structurally, the plants are relatively narrow, with fewer leaves than other varieties. The most notable thing about them (as the name suggests) are the massive buds that typically form around the central stem, and are dense and heavy. It’s not uncommon for the branches to break under their own weight, but this can be remedied with some tension wire or alternative support. These resin-coated buds produce formidable yields, which is the strain’s main selling point. When grown inside, users can anticipate around 500 to 600 grams per square metre. Outdoors, growers are likely to enjoy an even bigger harvest, of around 800 to 1200 grams per plant. Big Bud Feminized thrives in warmer climates with longer summers. Locations such as the Mediterranean are ideal. Alternatively, the plants can be grown indoors, or in a greenhouse. As most of Big Bud’s yield forms on the central stem, it’s the perfect candidate for the SOG (Sea of Green) system. The plants are flexible, and can be trained into whatever position is required. SCROG (Screen of Green) is also effective, and the strain responds well to supercropping and lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Big Bud FeminizedBig Bud Feminized is 85% indica. This means that the resulting high is powerful, sedative, and soothing. Some also report getting giggly and euphoric while using it, which may be a nod to the strain’s 15% sativa genetics. The plants produce a pleasant aroma as they’re growing; sweet, fruity and with a hint of spice. This is even more noticeable after harvesting, when the buds take on a scent that’s almost like molasses. Users will detect this sweet spiciness in the taste as well as the smell.Did you know? Big Bud responds excellently to the SOG (Sea of Green) system, and can be trained easily. It was originally created in the US, back in the 1980s. The War on Drugs drove breeders to take the strain to The Netherlands. Bid Bud comes in two other variants; Big Bud Regular and Big Bud Automatic.The strain produces impressive yields, which is why it’s a popular commercial option. Big Bud was a Cannabis Cup winner, in the category Indica Cup.</description><meta_title>Big Bud Feminized Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Big Bud Feminized is 85% indica.

Super harvests of chunky buds, super easy to grow, and (obviously) a super member of the skunk family! We gave the original Skunk #1 a boost to its yield and effects: We crossed it with a carefully chosen Afghan, then feminized the result so there’s no need to remove males. As an indica-dominant cannabis strain it’s reliably relaxing, with a 20% sativa component that lifts your mood and keeps lethargy away.Growth pattern of Super Skunk FeminizedSensi Seeds bred Super Skunk Feminized cannabis seeds were created to be a stronger, heavier-yielding version of the world-famous Skunk #1. Adding genetics from a pure-bred resinous Afghan hash plant achieved this. As with all feminised seeds, a major advantage is not having to identify and remove the male plants, providing an easy cultivation option for less experienced growers. However, this isn’t the only benefit that Super Skunk Feminized offers. The seeds produce an extremely uniform crop, which only grows to average heights during the flowering stage. Sturdy and conical in appearance, the plants are usually ready to harvest at the same time; and at the same height, making the process easier for growers. This reliability, combined with the shorter stature, is useful for gardeners who want to use the Sea of Green (SOG) or Screen of Green (SCROG) techniques to cultivate the plants, or who are looking for the homogeneity of a clone plant, with the simplicity of growing from seed. Super Skunk Feminized has a relatively short flowering period of 50 days maximum. This works well for indoor growers who want to enjoy two or even three harvests per year. Once the flowers start growing, they increase in size very quickly. They also multiply so rapidly that progress can sometimes be observed from one day to the next. The buds are a striking bright green colour, and are spiky, with large, pointy calyxes. Growers can anticipate generating large yields, even those with little experience behind them. The skunk family was initially bred to be a good indoors option; Super Skunk Feminized is an excellent example of the success of this effort. However, that doesn’t mean that the plants have to be grown inside. In Mediterranean climates, for example, Super Skunk Feminized will thrive outdoors. It also does well in a greenhouse. When grown in these conditions, it’s not uncommon for the plants to grow to the size of small trees, especially if the summer is long and warm. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk FeminizedTypically, skunk strains tend to produce a pungent odour (hence the name). Super Skunk Feminized is rather different, with a smoother, fruitier aroma. The Afghan parentage shines through, with earthy, spicy base-notes which are particularly strong during the flowering period. Indoor growers should be aware that this smell intensifies as harvest approaches. Once the buds are cured, they produce a more mellow version of the original scent, which is echoed in the taste. The citrus sweetness complements the warmer earthy notes perfectly. As for the effects that Super Skunk Feminized produces, most users describe it as a blend of uplifting contentment and relaxation. The euphoric lift is due to the sativa content, while the dominant indica genetics create a sense of calm. Some users value this strain for its ability to counteract feelings of stress and tension.

High-growing plants with long inflorescences and plenty of resin, which produce high yields, are typical of this variety of Haze.For many fans, Haze is a groundbreaking variety of cannabis; since the early 80s, it has been loved the world over. And even today, 40 years on, many growers are still looking for a strain that offers as many Haze qualities as possible.Silver Haze was the first variety of cannabis to provide the magical Haze high in a more compact, faster and higher-yield form. Sensi Seeds has spent many years working on the introduction of a reliable feminized variety of this strain, which has plenty of indoor potential. Silver Haze Feminized seeds are a purely feminine variety, which were backcrossed to their original Haze properties over generations. In addition to the Haze strain, we also used a non-dominant Northern Lights strain as the parent plant. Silver Haze Feminized Growth PatternThe result: high-growing plants with high yields, significant resin production and long inflorescences, which extend to the main stem and side branches. A colourfast sativa, Silver Haze Feminized is able to grow and flower almost simultaneously. Seedlings that are 1 metre high, which already begin to flower at 10 cm, are fairly common.The strong growth can also be used to encourage growth in other plants in the immediate vicinity or for a Screen of Green (SCROG). This variety of marijuana responds just as positively to lollipopping or supercropping techniques. Bear in mind that the geographical roots of the Haze variety lie in Thailand, Mexico and Colombia. Outdoor growing only works in regions where the plants are given sufficient time to flower. The plants should be left for 65 to 80 days.Effect, Flavour and Smell of Silver Haze FeminizedThe silver glandular hairs set the expectation: Silver Haze packs a powerful punch. The sensual, cerebral sativa high remains the most valued feature of the Haze family. Because Silver Haze Feminized doesn’t make you sluggish, this type of weed can also be used during the day. In terms of flavour, you can expect earthy tones consisting of notes of pine and wood. After enjoying the Haze, you will often experience a sweet aftertaste on the tongue.Did you know?Silver Haze won the High Times Cannabis Cup 1989.

This results in a 65% indica, 35% sativa that produces bumper harvests, while being easy to grow. Thanks to the sativa influence, the plants can sometimes reach towering heights, though can be kept more compact indoors. The high is reportedly happy, stimulating and euphoric. Growth pattern of Jack Flash #5 FeminizedJack Flash #5 Feminized cannabis seeds are 65% indica, 35% sativa. The strain was developed by Sensi Seeds, using the popular Jack Herer genetics, combined with a Super Skunk and a Haze variety. It presents itself in two phenotypes; one that is more typically indica (compact, stocky, with large buds), and one that’s taller, and requires more room to flourish. This is the feminized version of the strain. As such, the seeds are very unlikely to produce male plants, which makes cultivation much easier. This is beneficial for those that aren’t looking to produce seeds of their own, and who want reliability and predictability during cultivation. Jack Flash #5 Feminized has a relatively short flowering time of 55 to 75 days. The phenotype that’s more skunk-like in personality tends to be shorter. When grown in optimum conditions indoors, its height can be limited to around 100 cm. The taller phenotype produces much better results when given room to grow. Outside, these plants can reach heights of 180 to 250 cm (indoors, up to 180 cm). Structurally, both phenotypes differ quite significantly. The sativa-type is slender, with thin lateral branches. These branches are densely covered in weighty buds, which take on the classic spiral formation. The indica-type is squatter and bushier, with huge, fat calyxes. Jack Flash #5 Feminized is a big yielder, which is a major draw for growers. Outside, plants reliably produce around 600 grams each, which is a sizeable harvest indeed. Towards the end of the flowering period, the buds are heavy, massive and coated in resin. This strain performs best in countries with long, warm, sunny summers, such as those in the Mediterranean. The plants also grow well inside, or in a greenhouse. The indica phenotype is ideal for the SOG (Sea of Green) system, though growers report good results from SCROG (Screen of Green), lollipopping, and supercropping too. Effect, taste, and smell of Jack Flash #5 FeminizedJack Flash #5 Feminized is a 65% indica and 35% sativa strain. This blend really comes out in the high, which users claim is stimulating, cerebral and happy, whilst having a relaxing effect too. There’s also a mild psychedelic aspect to this strain, and it often promotes a sense of chattiness and thoughtfulness. As such, it’s well suited to social occasions. The aroma of the growing plants is fairly noticeable; a distinctive pine scent, with undertones of citrus and earth. This is particularly evident after the buds are cured, and can also be detected in the taste.

The DNA of this hybrid comprises 35% sativa and 65% indica genes.Skunk #1 Feminized from Sensi Seeds is incredibly uniform when grown from seeds, with plants displaying a consistent structure and regular flower clusters time and time again. After 30 years of experience with this strain, we can honestly say that it’s the finest example of feminized Skunk #1 we have ever seen. Although most skunk plants gain more height than pure indicas, the indica genes clearly dominate in the growth and flowering stage. Flowering is both rapid and rewarding thanks to the robust stems and branches. Look carefully, and you’ll see a subtle sativa effect in the bud structure.Skunk #1 Feminized can be grown outside in moderate climatic zones with normal summers. This strain also flourishes magnificently indoor under lamps.

The last thing some gardeners want is the element of surprise. However, there are those for whom a variety pack of cannabis strains is exactly what they’re looking for. Whether you’re wishing to select a few favourites or simply dive in to the diversity of cannabis, Feminized Mix has a lot to offer. Growth pattern of Feminized MixFeminized Mix is tailored for the experimental and adventurous grower. The seeds are not labelled; the only thing that unites them is that they are all feminized. When cultivating the plants, growers will need to observe which ones are indica dominant and which are sativa-based. This can be achieved by observing the leaves, and as the plants thrive, noting their overall size and form. Once the plants have been identified, indoor growers can put the feminized sativa strains into flower ahead of the indica ones. This encourages the entire crop to be ready for harvest at a similar time. Be aware, the heights of the plants may vary considerably, depending on the variant being cultivated. Confident gardeners may want to use Feminized Mix cannabis seeds to experiment with different training and cropping techniques. Sea of Green (SOG) and Screen of Green (SCROG) methods won’t be suitable in this instance, as they’re usually reserved for uniform crops. However, for growers with room to spare, supercropping, topping and fimming could all produce excellent results. In colder climates, growing indoors is advised. However, those who live in a warm, sunny places can cultivate Feminized Mix outdoors or in a greenhouse. This means that a staggered harvest is an option, by simply cutting each plant when it’s ready. Please note: there are likely to be more indica than sativa strains, as indica varieties tend to produce more seeds. All Feminized Mix packs are prepared randomly, so it’s not possible to predict what strains (or quantities) will appear in each one. Effect, taste, and smell of Feminized MixSensi Seeds Feminized Mix contains a variety of different seeds, which means that the user can enjoy a range of different flavours, scents and effects. Indica variants usually have earthy, spicy base notes, whereas sativa plants tend to offer fresh, grassy top notes (especially the Haze family). One of the major benefits of growing Feminized Mix is experiencing the diverse aromas and tastes of the cannabis flavour spectrum. The effects differ from plant to plant. Once the flowers are cured, some growers opt to keep the buds separate from the other plants, then try to guess which strains they have cultivated. Others like to mix the buds together to create a ‘cannabis cocktail’, and develop their own favourite blend. Did you know? Feminized Mix isn’t the only mixed pack that Sensi Seeds offer. There’s also an Indoor Mix and an Outdoor Mix (which are both more standardised)It’s a blend of indicas and sativas, perfect for adventurous growers who want to try out a range of different cannabis plantsThis mix often contains some prize-winning strains, including those that have won awards in the Cannabis Cup</description><meta_title>Feminized Mix Seeds - Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Feminized Mix cannabis seeds offer a random mix of premium Sensi Seeds strains.

Thanks to these potent genetics, it’s Sensi Seeds’ strongest skunk strain, and combines the multiple benefits of both parent plants; such as ease of growth and an intense, relaxing high. This is the feminized version of the Shiva Skunk strain, which means that there’s an extremely low chance of producing male plants. This ensures that cultivation is even simpler than before, making the seeds suitable for all growers – from novices to those with more experience. The plants have a relatively short flowering time of 45 to 55 days, which is useful for those who want to enjoy speedy results. Due to the strain’s mostly indica characteristics, they don’t grow to towering heights. Most reach a final height of around 110 to 120 cm, which means they can be cultivated discreetly in a garden or greenhouse. When grown outdoors, they’re usually ready to be harvested around mid-September.In appearance, Shiva Skunk Feminized is similar to Northern Lights #5. The plants have many branches, and although the flowers take a while to appear, when they do, the buds are dense, heavy and extremely resinous. The yield is sizeable too. When cultivated indoors, growers can anticipate around 400-450 g/m2 per plant. Outdoors, in the right conditions, this can reach as high as 600 – 850 g/m2. As the flowering period advances, Shiva Skunk Feminized’s buds swell significantly. That’s when you can expect to see the bulk of the resin production. Shiva Skunk Feminized flourishes in warm, continental climates. The plants also grow well in a greenhouse, or indoors at any time of the year. Experienced growers may want to use the SCROG (Screen of Green) or Sea of Green (SOG) techniques, as these tend to generate good results with this strain. Supercropping and lollipopping are also effective. Effect, taste, and smell of Shiva Skunk FeminizedShiva Skunk Feminized is 85% indica / 15% sativa, and this indica-dominance is very much in evidence in its taste, scent and effect. Like its parent-plants, Northern Lights #5 and Skunk #1, it produces a powerful high. Expect to experience intense relaxation, both in body and mind, along with a sense of serenity and thoughtfulness. Some claim that it produces a red-eyed, giggly effect too. While growing, Shiva Skunk Feminized produces a sweet, musky aroma, with a hint of citrus. This intensifies towards harvest time, and the resulting buds also feature this pleasantly skunky, citrus scent. In terms of taste, expect something that’s dense, thick and almost creamy on the tongue. Some also report notes of tropical wood and a rich earthiness. Did you know? Shiva Skunk (Regular) won 1st place for Outdoor Grow by The Urban Club (ES) at CANNAVAL.It also won 2nd place at BHO Copa de Asociaciones Canarias. It’s named after the Hindu deity Shiva. This is partly due to the fact that Shiva is often associated with cannabis, and partly because the strain is so powerful. Shiva Skunk is Sensi Seeds’ most potent skunk to date.Shiva Skunk Feminized comes in two other variant: Shiva Skunk Regular and Shiva Skunk Automatic.</description><meta_title>Shiva Skunk Feminized Seeds - Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Shiva Skunk Feminized is an 85% indica-dominant strain, and it’s Sensi Seeds’ most potent skunk variety.

Lush yields are possible, even in rainy Northern Europe. The robust nature and resilience of this cannabis strain mean it’s also of interest to novices. Until recently, it seemed impossible to grow skunks and other potent hybrids to full maturity in regions with short summers. Since the fat buds tend towards mould in poor weather, growers were forced to harvest their plants before flowering had reached its peak. Sensi Seeds set out to resolve this problem once and for all. Early Skunk Feminized growth patternThe answer is Early Skunk Feminized (35% sativa, 65% indica). These cannabis seeds combine the vitality and size of Skunk #1 with the hardiness of Early Pearl in a feminine hybrid with a turbo-charged result. On your balcony, in the garden or in any other sunny spot, Early Skunk will thrive anywhere!Its great reliability immediately catapulted Early Skunk into first place in our outdoor collection. This feminized strain, which produces female plants only, saves growers from having to weed out male shoots at the start of the flowering period. Just like the original, these seeds produce resistant, fast-growing and amazingly dynamic plants that yield bumper crops of moist, sugar-glazed buds. The inclusion of Early Pearl enables Early Skunk to mature weeks before Skunk #1, significantly increasing resistance to mould. During the flowering stage, Early Skunk Feminized achieves above-average growth. The plants can easily reach in excess of two metres. To exploit their full potential, you should leave them for 55 to 65 days. Your plants will thank you with resin-encrusted bud formation and rich yields that reveal their indica genetics.Advanced cultivation techniques such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Supercropping and Lollipopping are generally used for indoor cultivation, but they can also generate bigger yields outside in the fresh air. Effect, flavour and smell of Early Skunk FeminizedWhile the indica genes dominate in the growth pattern, the sativa components are immediately noticeable in the final effect. A mild, bright high combines with the warm, relaxing stone of skunk, taking smokers to new dimensions. Keep a few snacks close to hand, as this weed is known to trigger the munchies.During the flowering period, this cannabis strain has a rather intensive scent, but on consumption you’ll notice more of a mild sweetness. Don’t expect an explosion of flavour. Its mild aroma is precisely what many smokers love. Did you know?In 2006, Early Skunk won an award at the High Life Cannabis Cup.In addition to this feminized version of the strain, for purists we also offer Early Skunk Regular.</description><meta_title>Early Skunk Feminized Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Early Skunk Feminized is known for its bumper crops from outdoor cultivation, good mould resistance and a high that combines indica and sativa elements.</meta_description><url><![CDATA[https://sensiseeds.com/en/feminized-seeds/sensi-seeds/early-skunk-feminised]]></url><image><![CDATA[https://img.sensiseeds.com/en/feminized-seeds/sensi-seeds/early-skunk-feminised-thumb.png]]></image><price>66.01</price><currency>eur</currency><in_stock>Yes</in_stock><category>Feminized Seeds</category><flowering_min>55</flowering_min><flowering_max>65</flowering_max><strain_type>Feminized</strain_type><number_of_seeds>10</number_of_seeds><climate_zone>Cool /Cold</climate_zone><yield>XXL Yield</yield><heigh_gain>High plant</heigh_gain></item><item><itemtype>Product</itemtype><id>1560009</id><title>Northern Lights #5 x Haze Feminized Seeds</title><description>Northern Lights #5 x Haze Feminized has won numerous awards, and for good reason. Growers enjoy huge yields, and an invigorating and uplifting high. It’s a 70% sativa, but its 30% indica comes through in the plentiful resinous buds. The scent is potent and earthy, with a hint of citrus and pine. If the mother plants are well cared for, they’ll continue to produce great harvests, year after year. Growth pattern of Northern Lights #5 x Haze FeminizedNorthern Lights #5 x Haze Feminized cannabis seeds (sometimes called NL5 x Haze) are 70% sativa, with 30% indica thrown into the mix. Developed by Sensi Seeds, the award-winning strain displays its sativa-dominant genetics in the high (and the towering heights), though the indica influence is evident in the abundant yields and dense buds. This is the feminized variant, which means that the seeds are unlikely to produce any male plants. For growers that want an easier cultivation process, this is a big advantage. The plants have a slightly longer flowering time (of around 65 to 75 days); however, this extra wait is cancelled out by keeping the vegetation period short. Thanks to its sativa heritage, Northern Lights #5 x Haze plants can grow extremely tall. This is particularly the case when cultivated outdoors. In fact, in optimum conditions outside, it’s not uncommon for the plants to soar as high as 250 to 300 cm. Indoors, their growth is rather less lofty; growers can expect them to reach around 120 to 170 cm on average. Structurally, NL5 x Haze owes much to its sativa parentage; large and lanky, with long branches. Its buds swiftly fill the gaps between the internodes, and over time, become long and thick. In fact, the terminal buds can sometimes become wider and longer than the grower’s arm! It’s a big-yielding strain. When cultivated inside, growers frequently report harvests of around 450 grams per square metre. Outside, the yield is around 800 grams per plant. Northern Lights #5 x Haze flourishes in warm and sunny climates, with long summers. This is largely due to its extended flowering time. It’s well-matched to many training techniques, including SOG (Sea of Green), SCROG (Screen of Green), lollipopping, and supercropping. Effect, taste, and smell of Northern Lights #5 x Haze FeminizedNorthern Lights Feminized #5 x Haze is very much sativa-dominant. The sativa influence is particularly evident in the high, which is exuberant, cheery and creative. Users often claim that it makes them feel chatty too, which makes it a good choice for enjoying with friends. However, don’t underestimate the indica element. This comes through a while later – a deep, relaxing stone that calms the body and mind. While growing, NL5 x Haze produces a pleasantly spicy, citrussy aroma. This deepens towards harvest-time, and is very noticeable once the buds are cured. When consuming, be aware that it smells particularly potent! Taste-wise, users can expect to detect notes of citrus fruit and pine, along with earthiness and sweetness. Did you know? Northern Lights #5 x Haze has won multiple awards, including at the High Life Cup and the High Times Cannabis Cup events.This strain is also known as NL5 x Haze.If the mother plants are well tended to, they’re capable of producing excellent harvests for up to a decade; sometimes longer.

The strain is marginally indica-dominant (60% indica / 40% sativa), and this hybridisation offers the best of both worlds – vigorous growth and solid performance, combined with a potent, heady high. The seeds are feminized, which is useful for novice growers, as it means there’s no need to identify male plants and remove them. It’s also advantageous for those looking for an easier grow. However, Skunk Kush Regular is a better option for growers wanting to produce seeds for further cultivation. One of the major advantages to growing Skunk Kush Feminized is that it has a short flowering time; ideal for those who want to generate a harvest in rapid time. The flowering stage takes around 50 to 60 days whether indoors, or outside. If growing the plants in a greenhouse, expect to harvest them around late October. The plants’ moderate height is another bonus, especially if they’re being cultivated in a grow-room, or in a greenhouse or place with a low roof. Typically, they don’t extend beyond 150 cm, with most of the growing taking place during the flowering period. In fact, usually the plants are around 110 to 140 cm, which is an easy-to-manage height. Feminized Skunk Kush’s indica parentage is evident in the plant’s structure; thick stems, with dark-green, leathery leaves. However, Skunk #1 is detectable too; in the size, and the vigorous growth pattern. The buds form grape-like bundles, and the flowers are ‘towering’ in form. If extensive yields are a top priority, this is definitely a strain to consider. When cultivated in the right conditions, Skunk Kush Feminized produces abundant buds, and satisfyingly large harvests. Thick, Afghani-Skunk nuggets are to be expected when cultivating female plants, and also swollen calyxes. These generate dense, semi-open buds with a generous weight to them. The buds also produce plenty of resin, thanks to their large surface area. In fact, some of the trichomes are so bulbous that they actually seem to expand and change colour from day to day, especially near harvest-time. Skunk Kush Feminized grows best in warmer climates, and thrives in long summers. They’re susceptible to rot and mould, and as such, don’t do well in damper, cooler locations. Keen growers will be pleased to know that this strain responds well to various cultivation techniques, such as lollipopping, supercropping, and the SOG (Sea of Green) and SCROG (Screen of Green) methods. Effect, taste, and smell of Skunk Kush FeminizedMost people agree that Skunk Kush Feminized produces a powerful, all-encompassing high. It’s relaxing and calming, thanks to its 60% indica heritage. It’s sativa heritage provides an activating effect, with some noticing increased energy and excitement after consuming it. The strain not only packs a potent punch when consumed; it’s also got a distinctive scent. While the plants are growing, people usually notice a hint of spice and sweetness, with the familiar musky-skunk aroma coming through too. There’s also a hint of citrus, which gets gradually stronger as the buds get closer to harvesting. This fresh, citrus flavour carries through to the taste too, along with a hint of menthol, which is pleasantly invigorating. Did you know?

It’s a 90% indica-dominant strain, which means it’s compact and can be cultivated discreetly. Users report a blissfully relaxing stone, which soothes the muscles and calms the mind. The aroma is very indica in personality; earthy, rich and pungent. This carries through to the taste, which also features a hint of fruit and herb. Growth pattern of Northern Lights FeminizedNorthern Lights Feminized cannabis seeds are 90% indica, 10% sativa. The strain has both Thai and Afghani landrace genetics, and was redeveloped by Sensi Seeds. Now, it showcases many of the benefits of an indica-dominant plant; compact size, a relaxing high, plus a short flowering time. This is a feminized variant of the strain, which means that growing male plants is extremely unlikely. This makes cultivation simpler, which is useful for novice growers. Along with this, Northern Lights Feminized has an extremely short flowering time (just 45-50 days). Those who want swift results, or who want to achieve multiple grows throughout the year, will find this an advantage. Like many indica-dominant strains, Northern Lights Feminized is relatively small in size. When grown indoors, plants are usually about 80 to 130 cm in height. This is welcome news for growers that only have limited space within their property. Be aware though, when cultivated outside, the plants can reach heights of 150 to 200 cm, which means they’ll require more room to flourish. Northern Lights Feminized is bushy, multi-branched and sturdy in appearance. When grown in optimum conditions, it will develop many broad leaves and big buds, and produce extensive yields. Inside, the plants are likely to generate around 500 grams per square metre. Growers cultivating the plants outside can expect around 600 grams per plant. The buds are distinctive in appearance. As they develop, they gain a thick coating of resin, and they’re usually densely clustered. The plants thrive in warmer climates, especially in locations like the Mediterranean. They can also be grown indoors, or in a greenhouse. The SOG (Sea of Green) training system is ideal for Northern Lights Feminized, and produces excellent results. SCROG (Screen of Green) also works well, and lollipopping and supercropping is effective too. Effect, taste, and smell of Northern Lights FeminizedNorthern Lights Feminized’s genetics are mostly indica (90%), and this really shows in the resulting high. As can be expected from an indica-dominant strain, the stone is deeply sedative and intense, with users claiming that it relaxes the muscles and soothes the mind. It’s a fairly powerful high, which inexperienced users should be aware of. The aroma is typically indica in personality too. It’s pungent, earthy and rich, though not too overpowering. This is beneficial for those growing the plant inside, or looking for discretion when growing outside. The smell intensifies slightly as the buds become ready to harvest, and take on more complexity after curing. The scents of fruit and herb become particularly noticeable then, and can be detected upon tasting too. Did you know? Northern Lights has won several awards over the years.It’s such a prolific award-winner, that some have even asked for it to be left out of cannabis cups, to give other strains a chance. Northern Lights Feminized has been mentioned in various songs; particularly rap tracks. This strain is also available in two other variants; Northern Lights Regular and Northern Lights Automatic.It tends to grow well with higher levels of nitrogen.Northern Lights Feminized doesn’t produce much odour while growing, which is ideal for those cultivating it in their own homes.</description><meta_title>Northern Lights Feminized Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Northern Lights Feminized by Sensi Seeds is a 90% indica strain.

Yes, these seeds also have a sativa part, but at its heart it’s a plant with typical indica attributes. The Sensi Seeds genetics experts started breeding the Sensi Skunk family from a Skunk #1 which they crossed with a sweet mother plant.Like its relatives, these seeds thrive both indoors under artificial light and outside in moderate climates. The short flowering time, robust nature and thickly structured, strong buds are all reasons why this strain is so popular.

It’s not a strain for novices as it requires lots of tender loving care. The beautiful flower clusters and the energetic high compensate for the long flowering time.Sensi Seeds created Michka® at the same time as Eagle Bill®. During our breeding work, we noticed a special phenotype that immediately grabbed our full attention: elegant, tall, and with a delicious citrus scent. We soon came to the conclusion that we needed to retain and perfect this line. The result is a superior sativa, a cannabis strain that truly deserves the name Michka®. The feminized variant produces exclusively female plants, saving growers the effort of combing out male plants at the start of the flowing stage.Michka® Feminized growth patternThese plants grow quickly. They show little lateral branching, which can be an advantage depending on where they are grown. Michka® Feminized cannabis seeds produce very tall plants so require sufficient vertical space. What’s the answer if the growing room doesn’t have sufficient ceiling height? A Screen of Green (SCROG) may help in this case. This strain also responds well to other methods such as Supercropping or Lollipopping. Seeing a fully-grown Michka® flower outside is a very special experience. Outdoor growing requires a warm climate with long summers.Like many other sativas, Michka® Feminized has a long flowering time: reckon on 70 to 85 days. Towards the end of the flowering phase, the plants are completely covered in succulent buds. We have seen examples where the stem was invisible because there were so many buds on it. The thick, compact, light-green buds are quite unusual. Michka® Feminized produces loose buds with a structure a little reminiscent of popcorn. Because the spiral-shaped growth structure provides ample ventilation, the buds are well protected against mould.Effect, flavour and smell of Michka® FeminizedSativas are popular for their effect. Rather than the indica stone that can leave you chained to the sofa, they produce an energetic, uplifting high where everything seems possible. Michka® Feminized is the prime example of such a high. Because it encourages creativity, this strain is perfect for writers, musicians, painters and photographers. One drag is all you need to banish negative thoughts! This weed is not suitable for smoking before you go to sleep.Even a few weeks before harvesting, Michka® Feminized gives off a complex aroma. A blend of citrus fruits delights the nose.

Unlike the majority of sativas, these affordable cannabis seeds can also be grown outdoors in cool climates. The result: tall-growing, robust and discreetly scented cannabis plants.Mexican Sativa Feminized growth patternOur feminized Mexican Sativa is just as strong, tall and elegant as the original strain. These attributes are the result of its genetic origins in southern Mexico. But a pure sativa from Central America would be extremely difficult to grow, especially at our latitudes. So our Mexican Sativa also contains a dash of South Africa (Durban) and Pakistan (Hash Plant). This has allowed us to reduce the flowering time and improve resistance to cold. The result is a robust plant with 70% sativa genes that performs just as well in a growing room as it does outdoors. In a Mediterranean climate with long summers, Mexican Sativa can easily grow to a height of two metres. But it’s equally at home in cooler climates. During the flowering phase, which lasts 50 to 70 days, these plants grow vigorously, so sufficient ceiling height is crucial. The height gain can be reduced somewhat by keeping the growth phase short. Thinning out the plants increases this effect. The side branches respond well to this technique, and to other growing methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Lollipopping and Supercropping. Done properly, this can significantly increase the yield.Effect, flavour and smell of Mexican Sativa FeminizedConsumption of this cannabis strain produces a wave of euphoria, often accompanied by fits of the giggles. Because it doesn’t leave a feeling of fatigue or lethargy, Mexican Sativa can be enjoyed during the day and for physical activities. It takes quick and relatively long-lasting effect. During the growth and flowering phase, Mexican Sativa only gives off a subtle scent - a benefit for discreet growers. That changes once harvested and dried. The weed smells of a blend of sandalwood and flowery aromas, with an earthy pine undertone. Depending on the phenotype, there may also be liquorice and citrus notes. One thing we’re sure of: Mexican Sativa will tickle your mind as well as your taste buds.Did you know?Do you like heavy metal?

There are several phenotypes with different growth characteristics. The lasting effect is felt in both the mind and the body. Jack Herer® Feminized growth patternThe majority of phenotypes show distinct sativa growth behaviour, coupled with resin production and the lush flowering of an indica. Growers should be aware that these plants grow vigorously during the flowering stage. However, there is a more rare indica-dominated phenotype which does not spread as far and is altogether more compact. You’ve got to see the buds from this strain: they are some of the biggest in existence. With sativa phenotypes, resin-covered calyxes form at several points, lending the plants a wild appearance. Talking of resin: carefully cultivated buds glisten with a thick layer of THC-rich trichomes. Because this diamond-dusted appearance is maintained in the dried buds, they are extremely popular with sellers and smokers. If you examine a bud under the microscope, you will see that it is composed more from resin glands than from plant tissue. Depending on the phenotype, Jack Herer® Feminized is ready to harvest in around 10 to 12 weeks. Plants with a strong indica dominance can be harvested after just 8 weeks. Remember that this cannabis strain was developed for indoor cultivation. Outdoor cultivation will succeed only in a warm climate with plenty of sunshine.

Jamaican Pearl Feminized cannabis seeds combine a sweet aroma with an energetic sativa high. Because these are feminized seeds, which produce only female plants, success is guaranteed. Ideally suited for outdoor cultivation.Jamaican Pearl has its origins in a Sensi Seeds breeding programme which focused on tropical sativas. We have crossbred dozens of cannabis strains to get a Jamaica weed that will grow in northern climates, and even finish flowering in a rainy Dutch summer. Jamaican Pearl is a hybrid between Marley’s Collie and Early Pearl with a sativa content of 85%.Jamaican Pearl Feminized growth patternPlants sown early reach a height of up to 3 m outside. Flowering normally lasts from August to the end of September. At latitudes around 50°, the plants enjoy an additional month in flower. The large, shaggy and fast-growing buds mean the Jamaican Pearl Feminized is one of our most reliable and most productive outdoor strains. These seeds of course also thrive under artificial light. Following a short vegetation phase, the plants flower for nine to 11 weeks. This cannabis strain grows more bushily than most indoor types. If the ceiling of the growing room isn’t high enough, we recommend a Screen of Green (SCROG), with the plants secured to a trellis net. This strain is also suitable for Supercropping and Lollipopping.The majority of marijuana strains are tropical sativas, but a small part of their gene pool is determined by indica strains which came to the Caribbean islands from the Indian subcontinent. The shorter and wider growth pattern of the Jamaican Pearl Feminized, and the exceptional bud structure, are examples of the indica influence. Effect, flavour and smell of Jamaican Pearl FeminizedLooking for a weed to bring a smile to your face and banish all your worries? Try our pearl of Jamaica! Compared to Haze strains, the mood-enhancing high is relatively mild, but also more manageable. The effect fits well with daily activities, or with an evening with friends enjoying some great food. This cannabis strain produces buds with an intense flavour comprising fruity and earthy tones. Put it to the test and break open a freshly dried bud. Your fingertips will be covered with a sticky layer of resin with the scent of a summer’s evening in the Caribbean.Did you know?Jamaican Pearl is one of our award-winning strains.

Also suitable for novices. This original, pure indica comes from the Hindu Kush, a remote mountainous region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This classic variety owes a number of attributes that are beneficial to growers to its origins in the mountains. The thick coat of trichomes protect the plant against wind and poor weather. The white, glistening trichomes produce perfect hashish. They can also be enjoyed pure as kief. Plants grown from feminized Hindu Kush seeds are resistant to disease and mould. Novices love the great resilience in suboptimal growing conditions or fluctuating temperatures. Hindu Kush Feminized growth patternHindu Kush Feminized cannabis seeds produce plants with compact growth, a short flowering time (45 to 50 days) and medium yields. In the right hands, or given a longer growth phase, yields could be even higher. Grown in a moderate climate and given a long summer, the plants reach impressive heights. These cannabis strains produce short, strong branches with heavy buds that rapidly grow bigger in the flowering phase. These plants hold a lot of their energy in the central cola. This growth pattern makes them perfect for cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG) or Lollipopping. Effect, flavour and smell of Hindu Kush FeminizedHindu Kush Feminized brings a sense of deep peace, which is incredibly relaxing. Only few users report the often unwanted couch lock effect typical of indicas.Expect a distinctive aroma. It is a combination of aromatic woods and classic Afghan base notes. Many other hybrids are based on Hindu Kush, but the characteristic sandalwood flavour remains unique. There is a sweet note at the start of the flowering time, which, after the buds mature, is transformed into a savoury flavour that is immediately recognisable to aficionados. Did you know?Hindu Kush Feminized is an absolute classic among cannabis strains. Did you know that Katie Melua even dedicated one of her songs to this strain? “Halfway Up The Hindu Kush” is the perfect musical accompaniment to a relaxed evening on the sofa. According to “High Times” magazine, Hindu Kush from Sensi Seeds is one of the best 25 cannabis strains of all time.In addition to these feminized seeds, Hindu Kush is also available as Hindu Kush Regular and Hindu Kush Automatic.</description><meta_title>Hindu Kush Feminized Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Classic breeding in a modern format: Hindu Kush Feminized has a deliciously sweet scent of sandalwood, is easy to grow and is considered to be very robust.</meta_description><url><![CDATA[https://sensiseeds.com/en/feminized-seeds/sensi-seeds/hindu-kush]]></url><image><![CDATA[https://img.sensiseeds.com/en/feminized-seeds/sensi-seeds/hindu-kush-thumb.png]]></image><price>45</price><currency>eur</currency><in_stock>Yes</in_stock><category>Feminized Seeds</category><flowering_min>45</flowering_min><flowering_max>50</flowering_max><strain_type>Feminized</strain_type><number_of_seeds>10</number_of_seeds><climate_zone>Sunny / Mediterranean</climate_zone><yield>Medium Yield</yield><heigh_gain>Compact plant</heigh_gain></item><item><itemtype>Product</itemtype><id>1560020</id><title>Durban Feminized Seeds</title><description>Durban Feminized is a chunky subtropical sativa grows abundantly across southern Africa and is enjoyed everywhere. It’s an adaptable plant that can be cultivated in any location that offers from 8 to 12 hours of sunlight a day during the normal growing season. We created Durban Feminized cannabis seeds to produce a perfect outdoor sativa for growers of all experience levels. It’s quick, mould-resistant, and a great yielder, even in a disappointing summer!Growth pattern of Durban FeminizedWe've bred Durban Feminized cannabis seeds to produce exceptionally pure outdoor sativa plants. Parent strain Durban Poison is one of the world's most famous cannabis landraces, and we wanted to make it accessible to you. Developed using only specific plants from the established Durban gene pool, these seeds ensure the heritage of the strain remains intact. The plants are slightly shorter than other Durban strains. They also take less time to flower, and produce denser groups of flowers during the blooming stage. Expect to see a substantial main stem, flanked by strong lateral branches, develop during the vegetation period. Once flowering properly begins the calyxes grow at the nodes, then spread upwards, filling in the spaces on the branches and main stem. The short pistils are often pink or yellow to begin with, then darken as the plants continue to grow. Durban Feminized is a good option for beginners, as it can withstand most common grower errors. Its resilience and reliability mean it can produce plentiful yields, even in colder climates. The plants grow steadily. By keeping the vegetation period short and/or cutting them back, their height can be limited to just 150 centimetres if required. Using this approach makes it well-suited to growing in smaller gardens, or even on a balcony. Gardeners looking to maximise the height should start the seeds indoors in early spring, move them outside once the frosts are definitely over, then resist pruning or cutting them back. This approach results in plants that are around a metre taller. The height of Durban Feminized means it benefits from techniques like training or supercropping. If growing compact plants, the Sea of Green (SOG) or Screen of Green (SCROG) methods can be used instead. The thicker lateral branches mean that lollipopping isn’t usually beneficial. Effect, taste, and smell of Durban FeminizedDurban Feminized produces distinctively sweet aromas and flavours, with strong top notes of citrus and aniseed. Plants with darker leaves often have an earthier, warmer scent while they’re flowering, which subtly shifts to coffee, sandalwood or even chocolate. Celebrated for its powerful cerebral high, yet also calming and relaxing, Durban Feminized is ideal for creative activities. The effects are exceptionally smooth, but intense rather than mild.

It is characterised by the orange-dominated citrus flavour coupled with the taste of warm hashish.Our California Indica is the result of a high-yield, robust Orange Bud with sativa genes. We crossed this long-flowering parent plant with our Northern Lights #1 x Hash Plant, which already served as a pollen donor for our popular hash plant strain. Maintaining the enormous resin production was not easy, but following several attempts we finally succeeded. Compared with its sativa parent, the descendants impress with plentiful resin, a shorter flowering time and thicker buds. Unlike its indica father, it is differentiated by a fruitier flavour and a more focused high.California Indica Feminized growth patternCalifornia Indica Feminized seeds produce strong, primarily indica-dominated plants. Which means: this strain remains beautifully compact and flowers nice and quickly. The buds have long pistils which unfold between the main stem and upper branches and cover the plant’s internode gaps with thick flower clusters. And what amazing buds they are! These are real gourmet buds that are dripping with resin by the time they are harvested. After drying, the buds often look more orange than green in colour, which is perfectly normal. If cultivated indoors, growers should expect the plants to gain 100 to 150% in height during the 7 to 8-week flowering stage. If the flowering stage is introduced in a controlled way, there is nothing to worry about. In warm, continental climates, this cannabis strain can reach the height of a small tree. Special cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG), Supercropping and Lollipopping offer additional yield potential.Effect, flavour and smell of California Indica FeminizedCalifornia Indica Feminized’s effect is a mix of indica and sativa qualities, making it a good all-round strain. The warm, relaxing power of the Afghan indica is well balanced by the cerebral sativa high. It has a lasting effect but not so strong as to overwhelm inexperienced users.During the growing and flowering stage, these cannabis plants produce only a subtle scent, making it an interesting option for discreet stealth growers. The dried buds taste of hashish and sweet citrus fruits with dominant orange tones. More rare, and perhaps more popular, are phenotypes with lime and grapefruit flavours. One of our long-standing customers once described this cannabis strain as a “Citrus sativa for ganja gourmets”. We couldn’t have put it better ourselves. The intensive flavour of California Indica Feminized is perfect for a vaporizer. Slow heating brings the aromatic, heat-sensitive terpenes directly to the user. Did you know?Creatives will find a great source of inspiration in this weed. It’s no coincidence that there are several songs with the title ‘Orange Bud’ – a tribute to our California’s parent plant. These seeds are also available as California Indica Regular.</description><meta_title>California Indica Feminized Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>California Indica Feminized produces fast-flowering plants with resinous buds. 35% sativa and 65% indica genes ensure a pleasant hybrid high.</meta_description><url><![CDATA[https://sensiseeds.com/en/feminized-seeds/sensi-seeds/california-indica-feminized]]></url><image><![CDATA[https://img.sensiseeds.com/en/feminized-seeds/sensi-seeds/california-indica-feminized-thumb.png]]></image><price>54.99</price><currency>eur</currency><in_stock>Yes</in_stock><category>Feminized Seeds</category><flowering_min>45</flowering_min><flowering_max>50</flowering_max><strain_type>Feminized</strain_type><number_of_seeds>10</number_of_seeds><climate_zone>Temperate / Continental</climate_zone><yield>Heavy Yield</yield><heigh_gain>Compact plant</heigh_gain></item><item><itemtype>Product</itemtype><id>1560022</id><title>Afghani #1 Feminized Seeds</title><description>Afghani #1 Feminized delights growers with robust, fast-flowering plants with thick buds. If you’re looking for a genuine indica, this cannabis strain could be just the thing. Originating from our own hash plants, Afghani #1 yields solid results. Afghani #1 Feminized growth patternAlthough the name Cannabis indica originates from India, the best pure indicas are grown in Afghanistan. They are compact, potent and packed with buds – precisely the fine specimens yielded by Afghani #1.For an optimal harvest, these feminized cannabis seeds should be planted at least eight to ten weeks ahead of the flowering time. Afghani #1 Feminized seeds mature quickly and produce compact, lush buds. You can expect the plant to double in height approximately during flowering. The best results can be achieved with a single main stem and side branches, which should ideally not be pruned.Very little effort is required to grow this strain. Even as a novice, you can’t go wrong. Because these are feminized seeds, which produce female plants only, there’s no need to weed out the male shoots. If you want to boost the already rich harvest, try a Sea of Green (SOG). This cultivation technique for experienced growers works both indoors and outdoors. Afghani #1 Feminized is grown mostly under artificial light these days. Outdoor cultivation also promises success in moderate climates with long, hot summers.Take a look at the buds of the Afghani #1 Feminized and it soon becomes apparent why the predecessors of this cannabis strain are known as hash plants. The copious buds are covered with a thick layer of trichomes (resin glands). These contain more cannabinoids such as THC and CBD than any other part of the cannabis plant. Trichomes can be collected by dry sieving and consumed as kief, or further processed to produce hashish. Effect, flavour and smell of Afghani #1 FeminizedWhether consumed as weed, kief or hashish: Afghani #1 delivers the desired effect! Make sure you’ve finished your to-do list before consuming it, because there’s a good chance this potent indica will have you chained to your sofa. The body-centric, deeply relaxing and sensual effect is long-lasting, which many people appreciate. This cannabis strain has also earned itself a name as a natural relaxation aid. The resinous flavour is a central element in the bouquet of Afghani #1, which is complemented by earthy, sweet and very spicy notes. Did you know?Afghan indicas have done more to shape the face of modern cannabis cultivation than hardly any other genotype. From these hash plants, the most successful hybrid strains have inherited their thick growth, fast flowering and the resin production so popular with growers and consumers alike.This cannabis strain is also available as Afghani #1 Automatic and Afghani #1 Regular.</description><meta_title>Afghani #1 Feminized Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Afghani #1 Feminised is easy to grow, fast-flowering and perfect for hashish production.

This is a strongly sedative, almost pure indica with compact growth and a short flowering time.Sensi Seeds used four premium quality indica strains to create Black Domina. The result is an almost pure indica strain that packs more of a punch than the sum of its parts. We started with Northern Lights, one of our best-known strains thanks to its resin production. Then we added Ortega, which concentrates on the analgesic and soporific properties. The short flowering time and rich harvests come from the hash plant. Finally, we added an Afghanica known as “SA” to the mix. This gives Black Domina its strong growth and stable flower clusters.Black Domina Feminized growth patternThis four-way hybrid strain produces vigorous female plants with a degree of phenotype variation. In any case, growers can expect small height gain, intensive resin production, short flowering time (around 50 days) and fat buds. The dark green colouring is truly exceptional; in certain light conditions, the plants appear almost black. This pigmentation extends to the buds as well. Deep purple stripes are overlaid with orange hairs and a lush layer of trichomes. Black Domina Feminized cannabis seeds produce compact plants with a tendency to develop a solid central cola. Optimally suited for indoor cultivation, Black Domina Feminized can also be grown outdoors in regions with a Mediterranean climate. Either way, a Sea of Green (SOG) will yield the biggest harvests. Effect, flavour and smell of Black Domina FeminizedConsumers love this cannabis strain for its effect. It can be as strong as a narcotic. Before heading off to dreamland, every fibre of the body seems to relax. This weed is not recommended for daytime consumption, with one exception of course: “Netflix and chill”.The savoury flavours of Black Domina Feminized combine subtle tones of blackberry and pepper with a black hashish finish. Both the smell and taste contain this distinctive blend of aromas. They overlay an earthy Afghani undertone that experienced consumers will recognise immediately.

It’s not a strain for novices as it requires lots of tender loving care. The beautiful flower clusters and the energetic high compensate for the long flowering time.Sensi Seeds created Michka® at the same time as Eagle Bill®. During our breeding work, we noticed a special phenotype that immediately grabbed our full attention: elegant, tall, and with a delicious citrus scent. We soon came to the conclusion that we needed to retain and perfect this line. The result is a superior sativa, a cannabis strain that truly deserves the name Michka®. The feminized variant produces exclusively female plants, saving growers the effort of combing out male plants at the start of the flowing stage.Michka® Feminized growth patternThese plants grow quickly. They show little lateral branching, which can be an advantage depending on where they are grown. Michka® Feminized cannabis seeds produce very tall plants so require sufficient vertical space. What’s the answer if the growing room doesn’t have sufficient ceiling height? A Screen of Green (SCROG) may help in this case. This strain also responds well to other methods such as Supercropping or Lollipopping. Seeing a fully-grown Michka® flower outside is a very special experience. Outdoor growing requires a warm climate with long summers.Like many other sativas, Michka® Feminized has a long flowering time: reckon on 70 to 85 days. Towards the end of the flowering phase, the plants are completely covered in succulent buds. We have seen examples where the stem was invisible because there were so many buds on it. The thick, compact, light-green buds are quite unusual. Michka® Feminized produces loose buds with a structure a little reminiscent of popcorn. Because the spiral-shaped growth structure provides ample ventilation, the buds are well protected against mould.Effect, flavour and smell of Michka® FeminizedSativas are popular for their effect. Rather than the indica stone that can leave you chained to the sofa, they produce an energetic, uplifting high where everything seems possible. Michka® Feminized is the prime example of such a high. Because it encourages creativity, this strain is perfect for writers, musicians, painters and photographers. One drag is all you need to banish negative thoughts! This weed is not suitable for smoking before you go to sleep.Even a few weeks before harvesting, Michka® Feminized gives off a complex aroma. A blend of citrus fruits delights the nose. When smoked or in a vaporiser, this potent weed has an even stronger citrus flavour, but also tastes deliciously sweet.

Previously called Sensi #11, Sensi Seeds’ community chose both its place in our permanent catalogue, and its new name. Its genetic pool features world-renowned strains, such as the award-winning Silver Haze, Blueberry, and Afghani #1. The sativa influence means that the plants can grow to towering heights, while the indica results in generous yields. Cobalt Haze produces a pleasantly fruity aroma and thrives in sunny, Mediterranean climates. Growth pattern of Cobalt Haze Feminized Cobalt Haze Feminized cannabis seeds were developed by Sensi Seeds. The strain has an impressive genetic pool, featuring plants like Silver Haze, which has won multiple awards; dependable indica Afghani #1; and deliciously fruity Blueberry. This balanced parentage can be seen in the sativa-like heights of the plants, and the indica abundance of the harvests. The seeds are feminized, which means only plants which flower as though they’re female will be produced. This makes cultivation easier, as it reduces the need to identify and remove male plants. It has an average flowering time, so growers won’t need to wait too long until harvest. However, it’s important to be aware that this strain, like many sativa-dominant variants, is capable of growing to substantial heights, especially when planted outside. As the harvests are substantial, growers can anticipate the plants forming plenty of buds during the flowering stages. When cared for properly, in the right conditions, it’s relatively easy to maximise the yield without putting too much effort in. Cobalt Haze performs best in Mediterranean countries, or any location with a warm climate and a long summer. Effect, taste, and smell of Cobalt Haze Feminized Cobalt Haze is a balance of sativa and indica, and this is evident in the high, the aroma and the taste. Users report experiencing deep relaxation upon consumption, though there’s a noticeable sativa uplift, often accompanied by a burst of mental alertness and creativity.

Users report a high that’s happy, uplifting, and powerful.Originally part of the inaugral Sensi Seeds Research project in 2019, Silver Fire proved so popular with our community that we decided to add it to our catalogue – despite it not being one of the final three choices!Growth pattern of Silver Fire Feminized Silver Fire Feminized cannabis seeds have formidable parentage. The strain is an indica / sativa hybrid; its parent plants are the award-winning Silver Haze, and the popular US strain, Fire OG. The seeds are feminized, and as such, an advantage for less experienced growers; it means there’s no pressure to identify and remove male plants. The strain has a fairly long flowering period, which provides it with plenty of time to produce a large amount of buds – ideal for those who want to generate bumper harvests. Growers can expect the plants to grow to average heights. However, it’s important to be aware that they grow very quickly during the flowering period – sometimes stretching by as much as 200% during this time. This is a very sativa trait, and in appearance, they’re also reminiscent of a sativa, with plenty of buds around the central cola and lateral branches. These buds usually result in formidable yields; one of the reasons that Silver Fire Feminized has rapidly become so popular. Care needs to be taken during cultivation though, to ensure that the harvest is maximised. The plants perform at their best when grown in a warm, sunny climate with a long summer. Alternatively, they can be cultivated indoors, all year round. Effect, taste, and smell of Silver Fire FeminizedSilver Fire Feminized is an indica / sativa hybrid. This hybridisation is evident in the scent, the taste, and the resulting high. Upon consumption, users report that the strain leaves them feeling relaxed, happy and euphoric. It’s a fairly powerful, fast-acting high; so much so that novice users should be aware of how rapidly it can affect them!

Its name was changed from Sensi #49 in 2020, following the suggestions and then votes of the Sensi Seeds community. The strain has an impressive cannabidiol (CBD) content, with a ratio of 1:2 THC to CBD. It’s also compact enough to be grown discreetly, and produces super-large yields without too much effort. Another advantage is the ability to grow the plants in temperate and continental climate. When it comes to the effects, users can anticipate something that’s pure kush in personality: potent and deeply relaxing. Growth pattern of Himalayan CBD FeminizedThe strain Himalayan CBD Feminized got its name from the Sensi Seeds community; prior to 2020, it was called Sensi #49. Its parent plants are Hindu Kush and OG Kush, which are both celebrated for their powerful, full-body stone, and the breeding selection process has pushed up the CBD content. The seeds are feminized, which is advantageous for less experienced growers, as it removes the need to identify and remove male plants. All the plants produced by Himalayan CBD Feminized will grow and flower as though they are females. This strain also has a high cannabidiol content, with a THC to CBD ratio of 1:2. Each crop has an average flowering time, which means that growers won’t have to wait too long to generate a good harvest. They’re also compact (thanks to the indica influence), so they can be grown discreetly both inside and outdoors. Appearance-wise, the plants usually have a thick central cola, around which most of the buds will form. Under the right growing conditions, there are likely to be an abundance of buds, as this strain is capable of producing bumper yields. However, to get a really impressive harvest, a little care and attention may be required. Himalayan CBD Feminized grows well in both temperate and continental climates, and thrives in a normal, warm summer. Alternatively, it can be successfully grown indoors. Effect, taste, and smell of Himalayan CBD FeminizedHimalayan CBD Feminized is an indica /sativa hybrid. However, like its parent plants, OG Kush and Hindu Kush, it’s capable of producing a deep indica stone, which is relaxing for both body and mind. Users can anticipate a strongly soporific effect, and should be aware that it is potent and fast-acting. The scent is both sweet and sour, with notes of exotic wood and pine. As with many cannabis breeds, the aroma intensifies as harvest-time approaches. Likewise, the taste is a combination of sweet notes and more tangy, bitter flavours, and is earthy, rich and woody.

It was developed from two notable plants: Swiss Dream, and Skunk #1, one of the world’s best-known skunk strains. The plants are compact enough to be grown discreetly, and produce a pleasantly spicy, earthy aroma. They also thrive in colder climates and generate heavy yields without too much work. The THC/CBD ratio is 1:30, and the effect is gentle and relaxing. This strain was originally a part of the 2019 Sensi Seeds Research Project. The choice of which varieties would become part of our permanent catalogue was so close, and the community response to this strain was so strong, that we decided to bring Alpine Delight CBD Automatic into the family for good.Growth pattern of Alpine Delight CBD AutomaticAlpine Delight CBD Auto cannabis seeds are the result of an indica / sativa hybrid: Swiss Dream crossed with Skunk #1. The seeds are autoflowering. This is an advantage for novice growers, as it means that the plants enter their flowering stage at a defined point in their growth, instead of being influenced by light cycles. The autoflowering trait means more predictability, making them easier to care for. Autoflowering seeds are also resilient, and perform well in most climates; even locations with colder, shorter summers can produce great results. Alpine Delight CBD Automatic has a relatively long flowering period (although still shorter than non-automatic varieties). However, the wait is worth it, as the plants are capable of producing impressively large yields. They’re also compact in height, which is beneficial to those who want to cultivate them without attracting a lot of attention. It’s a fairly squat, bushy strain, and during its flowering stage, will generate a lot of buds. These buds usually develop without needing too much care and attention, resulting in bumper harvests, both indoors and outside. It’s hardy enough to be grown in colder, more temperate locations; alternatively, the plants can be cultivated indoors at any time of the year. Effect, taste, and smell of Alpine Delight CBD AutomaticAlpine Delight CBD Automatic is an indica / sativa hybrid. It’s also got a high percentage of ruderalis genetics, which can be clearly seen in the plants’ hardiness in most climates. The effect is subtle and relaxing. Indeed, thanks to the THC to CBD ratio (1:30), it’s actually so mild that the strain would be classified as industrial hemp in countries like Italy and Switzerland. This makes it a suitable choice for those who aren’t used to consuming cannabis, or who want a gentle, soothing effect for the end of the day. With the rise in interest in CBD as a wellness supplement, there is a growing number of people who want to be able to use cannabis for its cannabidiol (CBD) content, without having to experience a THC high. Alpine Delight CBD Automatic is a perfect choice for this.The scent and taste of Alpine Delight CBD Automatic reflects its gene pool. There are hints of sweetness and spice from Swiss Dream, but also an earthy skunk smell and flavour, thanks to the Skunk #1 influence. In a nutshell The plants are compact enough to be grown in small spaces, both outdoors and insideThe aroma and taste are sweet, spicy and slightly earthy, with a hint of skunkThe THC / CBD ratio is 1:30The THC levels are so low that the strain is classified as industrial hemp in some countriesAs an auto, the plants are able to grow in most climates, even those with cooler, shorter summers</description><meta_title>Alpine Delight CBD Automatic Seeds - Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Alpine Delight CBD Automatic is a robust hybrid.

This special strain began life as one of our 2019 Sensi Seeds Research varieties. Despite initial plans to only add three of them to our permanent catalogue, this one received such great feedback from our community that we decided to include it too. Growth pattern of Black Harlequin FeminizedBlack Harlequin Feminized cannabis seeds are an indica / sativa hybrid. Its genetic pool features Sensi Seeds’ Black Domina, a Cannabis Cup winner; and Harlequin, a respected CBD strain from the USA. This strain is feminized, which is useful for growers who don’t want to have to identify and remove male plants. It makes cultivation easier for novices, and anyone desiring a simple-to-grow variety. The plants have an average flowering period, so there isn’t too long to wait until harvest time. Black Harlequin Feminized’s plants are usually average in height, both indoors and outside. They’re also capable of producing phenomenally large yields, especially in the hands of a grower with good cultivation skills. In appearance, the plants are fairly bushy with a thick central cola. They’re also covered in plentiful compact buds. The strain can be grown successfully in both temperate and continental climates, and also does very well when cultivated indoors, at any time of the year.

Its genetic heritage includes an undisclosed CBD strain, giving it a THC / CBD ratio of 2:1. The plants have striking, dark green leaves, and grow to average heights. They also produce incredibly large yields, especially with a little extra attention. Growers will be able to cultivate them in both temperate and continental climates. The effect is blissfully relaxing, with a hint of cerebral uplift. Launched under a code number as part of the first Sensi Seeds Research project in 2019, this strain proved to be such a hit with our cannabis community that we chose to add it to our permanent Sensi Seeds catalogue.Growth pattern of Satin Black Domina CBD FeminizedSatin Black Domina CBD Feminized cannabis seeds are a sativa / indica hybrid. Like the mother plant (our own Black Domina), the plants have a striking dark green colour, and have been developed using an undisclosed CBD strain. This has resulted in a THC / CBD ratio of 2:1. The seeds are feminized, something that’s very beneficial for less experienced growers. All the plants they produce will flower like females, which means there’s no need to identify and remove unwanted male plants. Gardeners can expect an average flowering period with this strain, and won’t need to wait too long before harvest. The plants also grow to an average height, and don’t require much room to flourish, either indoors or out. They form plenty of buds, which results in extra-large yields. This can be maximised with a little bit of additional care. Appearance-wise, the most noticeable thing about Satin Black Domina Feminized is the colour: a rich deep green that appears almost black in certain lights. The central cola is typically sturdy and thick, as you’d expect from an indica-dominant strain. The plants can be cultivated in both temperate and continental climates, and also thrive when grown indoors. Effect, taste, and smell of Satin Black Domina CBD FeminizedSatin Black Domina CBD Feminized is an indica / sativa hybrid with CBD genetics. This CBD influence is evident in the resulting effect, though the scent and taste are more in-line with the parent plant, Black Domina. Upon consumption, users report a sense of pleasant relaxation, combined with a hint of uplift and creativity. The aroma of the plants is peppery and fruity, with a hint of hashish. This usually grows in strength as they near harvest-time, and carries through to the taste, when the earthy Afghan tones come to the foreground.

The plants can thrive outdoors even in short summers and wet weather. For growers who are looking for compact plants that don’t need a lot of maintenance to produce solid buds, this strain is a perfect choice. Growth pattern of Super Skunk AutomaticSuper Skunk Automatic cannabis seeds produce potent, fast-flowering plants. They’re 80% indica, which means they’re typically compact. They’re also autoflowering, which is ideal for those with limited experience, energy, or time. The plants start to flower after a predetermined period, around three to five weeks after the seedlings appear. Although the appearance of the flowers is not impacted by the amount of daylight the plant receives, the plants will benefit from an extended light cycle (14 to 18 hours a day) to increase strength and yield. The flowering stage usually lasts seven to nine weeks, and the plants don’t revert to vegetative growth, even if the photoperiod is unpredictable. Usually, Super Skunk is grown indoors under lighting. However, this Automatic variant of Super Skunk can also thrive outside in temperate climates. If the summer is cooler, the plant’s autoflowering capability means its blooming time can be synchronised with the longest days of the season. This results in the buds and resin developing in the sun, rather than in the colder, damper autumn months. Super Skunk autoflowering plants are relatively compact, which means that techniques like topping and supercropping aren’t suitable in this instance. Most gardeners use Automatic strains to avoid as much maintenance and interference with the plants as possible. However, those with more experience and a curious nature might want to experiment with the Sea of Green (SOG), Screen of Green (SCROG) and lollipopping techniques. These all work well with the plant’s ‘bud on a stick’ growth pattern. The buds are dense, well-sized and bright green, with a generous coating of trichomes and large calyxes. Super Skunk Auto isn’t the biggest yielding strain, but will produce rewarding harvests. A larger growing space and longer hours of light during the flowering period help to maximise the yield. Make no mistake though, this plant’s buds are satisfying and by no means small. Effect, taste, and smell of Super Skunk AutomaticSuper Skunk Automatic’s scent often surprises people. Unlike other strains in this family, the aromas aren’t overpowering, and are reminiscent of sweet citrus. The base notes are warm and spicy like other skunk-type cannabis, which showcases the plant’s indica heritage. The aromas become more noticeable as flowering begins, but are not as overpowering as the Regular and Feminized expressions of Super Skunk. Scents reach their peak in the final week. After curing, the lemon smell of the buds becomes less prominent. However, once consumed, the flavours are immediately noticeable. Super Skunk Automatic’s effects are well suited for both recreational and medicinal use. The overall sensation is one of relaxation (thanks to the 80% indica), though there is an uplifting aspect to the buds, which is due to the sativa element. Plants that are cultivated outdoors tend to be less potent than those grown inside. This is true of most cannabis strains. This reduction in strength often appeals to those looking for a cannabis plant that offers good pain or stress relief, minus the intensity. It also makes it a good choice for those who are unused to consuming cannabis. Did you know?

Skunk #1 Automatic seeds reliably and quickly produce THC-rich buds with minimal effort.Skunk #1 Automatic growth patternWe realise expectations are high when a legend like Skunk #1 is redeveloped as an autoflowering version. Our aim was clear from the outset: the auto descendent had to live up to its famous mother, and further simplify the already easy cultivation. If we look at the positive feedback from the community, we think we’ve achieved that. A defining feature of Skunk #1 Automatic, which is based on 35% sativa and 65% indica genes, is the ease with which it can be grown. With this feminized auto variant, the duration of the light period doesn’t matter, because flowering begins automatically. The plants start to produce large, resinous buds approximately three weeks after germination. The flowering phase lasts 45 to 55 days; the plants grow less vigorously than regular Skunk #1, and stay nice and compact. Once mature, the large and dense buds are astonishing to behold. For an auto strain, there is a very high proportion of buds to leaves. Most of the THC is contained in the glistening resin glands, which are also known as trichomes.If these automatic seeds germinate in the spring, an initial harvest in June is entirely possible. Autoflowering cannabis strains allow for several harvests per year. Skunk #1 Auto also thrives excellently indoors under artificial light.Cultivation methods such as Sea of Green (SOG) or Lollipopping often result in an even greater harvest.Effect, flavour and smell of Skunk #1 AutomaticThe effect of Skunk #1 Auto is also astonishingly close to the original. The combination of heady high and physical stone is typical of a hybrid. After just a few drags, users feel a wave of energised euphoria rise up inside them which, after a while, dissipates into a relaxed feeling. Users feel pleasantly dazed and deeply relaxed, a little bit like after a long session in the sauna. The raw flavour of Ruderalis, which is found in every autoflowering cannabis strain, is not perceptible during use. The mild buzz is not scratchy; it tastes earthily sweet but also a little sharp - typically ‘skunky’ then. Did you know?Skunk #1 has been one of our best-sellers for many years. The various versions of this strain have won multiple awards.Rappers show a clear preference for skunk strains. Their lyrics have played a big part in making the word skunk the colloquial term for all potent cannabis strains.Skunk #1 from Sensi Seeds is also available as Skunk #1 Regular or Skunk #1 Feminized.

Northern Lights Automatic can be cultivated in cooler climates, though it performs better in warmer conditions, where it’s possible to get two or three harvests each year.

It produces huge, weighty buds, which are completely covered in resin. The scent is distinctive too; sweet, earthy and spicy, with a generous hint of skunk. As for the high? It’s an indica-dominant variety (80%), so expect a deeply relaxing, intense body stone.Growth pattern of Big Bud AutomaticBig Bud Automatic cannabis seeds are 80% indica. Originally created in the US in the 1980s, Big Bud was taken to The Netherlands and then further hybridised and stabilised. Sensi Seeds brought it back to its roots, then added Skunk #1 and Northern Lights to its genetic background. The result? A high-yielding automatic variant, which produces a typically indica high. This is an autoflowering strain, which makes it ideal for novice growers. As an auto, it’s capable of thriving in most climates, and offers a faster flowering time too. Growers can expect 45-55 days of flowering in total, with a growth cycle of around 13 to 17 weeks. This is advantageous for anyone wanting swift results, or multiple harvests per year. Big Bud Auto is a medium-sized plant, regardless of whether it’s cultivated inside or out. Most plants will range from 90 to 130 cm; with those grown outdoors reaching slightly larger heights (of around 150 cm at most). Appearance-wise, they’re easily identified by their noticeable central cola and large, plentiful buds, which gather mostly around the stem and on the higher branches. Most autoflowering strains produce a lower yield than their regular or feminized counterparts. However, this strain offers impressively large harvests for an automatic variety. Indoors, plants often produce up to 400 – 450 g/m², with outdoor plants generating around 100 – 175 grams each. The distinctive buds are a key feature of Big Bud Automatic. They’re huge, and retain most of their size even after curing. The buds are also heavy; so heavy that they sometimes break the branches they’re growing on. As such, the plants may require some support during the later stages of flowering.As this is an autoflowering strain, it’s robust enough to be grown even in colder climates. It can of course also be cultivated indoors, or in a greenhouse.Effect, taste, and smell of Big Bud AutomaticBig Bud Automatic’s indica genetics are immediately detectable upon consumption. Users often report a heady, complete-body high, which is relaxing and intense. The 15% sativa element adds a hint of euphoria. The Afghan heritage of this plant makes itself known through its scent, which is sweet, musky and spicy. The aroma intensifies after harvesting and curing, and can also be tasted. Did you know?Big Bud Auto requires minimal training, as it grows extremely fast.It has such heavy buds that sometimes, plants will require additional support towards harvest-time.Bid Bud Auto is Sensi Seeds’ highest-yielding autoflowering strain.It comes in two other variants; Big Bud Regular and Big Bud Feminized.Big Bud is a prize-winning strain (Cannabis Cup – indica category).</description><meta_title>Big Bud Automatic Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Big Bud Autoflowering cannabis seeds are 80% indica.

In many ways, it’s a classic, easy-to-grow indica, much like its equally popular parent-plant, the Northern Lights #5. Growth pattern of Shiva Skunk AutomaticThis is an autoflowering strain, which makes it a natural choice for beginners. Auto varieties are also ideal for growers looking for a low-maintenance plant, without compromising too much on yield. Shiva Skunk Auto is hardier than your average cannabis plant which means it can be grown outside in most climates; even places with cooler, wetter summers as well as indoors. The autoflowering properties also mean that it can be grown in places with unusual photoperiods. This includes locations like the equator (where normally, only sativas would thrive), and the far north, in countries with long midsummer days. Shiva Skunk Automatic has a relatively short flowering time. Whether it’s grown indoors or out, expect it to start flowering around the time the plants produce their fifth to eighth set of full-sized leaves. This usually happens after six to eight weeks of vegetative growth. Like many indica-dominant strains, Shiva Skunk Auto is a compact plant. During its flowering period, it’ll reach its final height, which is likely to be between 90 to 140 cm. This is an advantage for the discreet grower, as it means no towering, noticeable plants! Shiva Skunk Auto cannabis seeds produce compact and densely budded plants. Growers often appreciate their distinctive green/ silver colouring, not to mention the plentiful resin production. The leaves are classically skunk in appearance; elongated, narrow and dark. All autoflowering strains of cannabis produce slightly reduced yields when compared to the feminized or regular variants. However, this auto performs well, providing a solid yield, without much maintenance or effort involved. For many growers, this is a trade-off they’re more than happy to accept. Later in the flowering stages, expect to see the buds increase in mass, becoming heavier and more resinous as the days go on. By the time they’re ready to harvest, they’ll be coated with a layer of resin glands – yet another nod to the parent-plant, Northern Lights #5. The coating of trichomes may become even more noticeable once the buds are dried and cured. As with all cannabis flowers, the buds shrink as they dry; and this makes the resin glands even more apparent. Expect the dried buds to be an exceptional pale silver-green colour, with blunt-tips and a glistening sheen. In fact, if you peer at them under a magnifying glass, you might spot tiny rainbows being refracted – this is because a large portion of the resin glands remain clear, even after they’ve been dried. For those looking for a strain that’s hardy, and well adapted to most climates, Shiva Skunk Auto is a solid choice. As it flowers automatically, many growers don’t attempt to train it; however, some people have enjoyed success with the SOG (Sea of Green) and SCROG (screen of green) growing methods. It also responds well to supercropping and lollipopping. Effect, taste, and smell of Shiva Skunk AutomaticThis indica-dominant plant produces an intense, yet mellow high. Heady and cerebral, it often inspires deep thought, or sometimes even enthusiasm and laughter, thanks to its 20% sativa parentage. Users often describe a feeling of enjoyable physical relaxation, and some also use it for medicinal purposes. While the plants are growing, you’ll detect the recognisable musky scent of skunk, though Shiva Skunk Auto also has a pleasant, citrus aroma. This smell becomes earthy after harvesting, when the buds are drying. When consumed, the earthiness is more noticeable, with a fresh, lemon / skunk flavour. Did you know? Shiva Skunk Automatic won 1st place for outdoor grow by The Urban Club, at Cannaval It was awarded 2nd place in the BHO Copa de Asociaciones CanariasIt also comes in Shiva Skunk Feminized and Shiva Skunk Regular variantsIt’s named after the Hindu god Shiva, who is often associated with cannabis</description><meta_title>Shiva Skunk Automatic Seeds – Sensi Seeds</meta_title><meta_description>Shiva Skunk Automatic cannabis seeds are 80% indica, 20% sativa and produce an intense, cerebral high.

Quick success is assured, even with no growing experience, because this strain is ideal for novices and experts alike.Afghani #1 Automatic growth patternThe short, fast growth pattern of the indica genotype is a result of the conditions of a high altitude environment. Such conditions are found in Afghanistan’s Hindu Kush mountains. For generations, cannabis strains have been selectively bred there for potency, weight and resin production. Our Afghani #1 uses only the best indica parent plants from the region. What should you expect? Robust, medium-height plants with distinct lateral branches and dark green foliage. The plants will begin to flower after five to seven weeks of growth – and you don’t need to do a thing to help them. This strain is ready to harvest after another seven to nine weeks. The complete cultivation process – from seedling to harvest – takes just three months. Dense flowers soon cover the shoots of the plants, with the best results achieved from a main stem and unpruned side branches. As with other autoflowering strains, you should not remove the heads, because topping will not result in better branching or more flowers. To increase the yield, try a Sea of Green (SOG). This cultivation method uses a lot of small plants instead of a few large plants. The buds from these plants maintain their weight even after drying. They are packed with trichomes. These are the resinous glandular hairs of the cannabis plant, which are smoked pure as kief or further processed into hashish. It’s no coincidence that the Afghan ancestors of this strain were called hash plants. They provided the material for black hashish, which was traditionally shaped by hand into balls and consumed on the Indian sub-continent as Charas.Effect, flavour and smell of Afghani #1 AutomaticWhether you smoke the buds as weed or produce your own delicious hashish, the relaxing, very powerful indica effect of this strain won’t disappoint! Inexperienced consumers will experience a strong sedative effect even from a small dose.The spicy flavour of cannabis resin is a strong element of this strain’s bouquet, coupled with sweet, earthy and smoky notes.Did you know?Afghan indicas have shaped cannabis cultivation for a long time. The exceptional resin production of modern indoor strains is more or less derived from the DNA of the hash plants.In addition to these autoflowering seeds, Afghani #1 is also available as Afghani #1 Feminized and Afghani #1 Regular.</description><meta_title>Afghani #1 Automatic Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>The resinous buds of Afghani #1 Automatic are suitable for producing hashish.

Our Hindu Kush Automatic is affordable, robust, easy to grow and ready to harvest in record time. Hindu Kush Automatic growth patternHindu Kush has been a favourite of old-school indica fans for over two decades. It soon became clear to us: we need to sell this cannabis strain as autoflowering seeds as well. Hindu Kush is renowned for its reliable growth pattern and this new automatic variant will make harvesting high-quality indica buds even easier for you. Novices and medicinal users will be delighted by how little work and effort is required to grow this strain. Even the regular variant of Hindu Kush is suitable for novices, with its short flowering time and easy management. Even if you make cultivation mistakes, it won’t really be a problem because this strain is wonderfully robust. Hindu Kush Auto ensures added resistance and reliability. There’s no need to remove male plants, because these seeds only produce female plants. This autoflowering variant develops buds automatically without having to adapt the lighting cycles. The short flowering time of 45 to 50 days allows for several harvests from the same area. These short, bushy plants are a big advantage in interior spaces with low ceilings. In warm regions with plenty of sunshine, Hindu Kush Automatic cannabis seeds also flourish outside. With its strong branches, this strain is excellent for Sea of Green (SOG) or Lollipopping. Effect, flavour and smell of Hindu Kush AutomaticHindu Kush Automatic offers a long-lasting, mellow high that brings you peace and mild relaxation, without completely locking you to the sofa. Only few users report feelings of anxiety and paranoia, which other cannabis strains can trigger. But remember: you can always use more, but you can’t go back and use less.The earthy flavour notes have a sweet component reminiscent of sandalwood, incense and pine. During the growth period, these plants have only a discreet smell. After drying, the flavour and aroma of the solid buds acquire a sharper version of the original smell.Did you know?In her song “Halfway Up The Hindu Kush”, the British singer-songwriter Katie Melua sings of things she’d never seen. Creative minds like hers value Hindu Kush for its mind-expanding properties. According to the well-respected magazine “High Times”, Hindu Kush is one of the best 25 cannabis strains of all time.In addition to these autoflowering seeds, Hindu Kush is also available as Hindu Kush Regular and Hindu Kush Feminized.</description><meta_title>Hindu Kush Automatic Seeds – Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Hindu Kush Automatic offers far more than its low price might suggest.

It has an impressive gene pool, with its parent plants being Skunk #1 and Blueberry. Originally called Sensi #119, it was renamed in a 2019 competition by Sensi Seeds’ cannabis community. Thanks to the indica influence, the plants are compact enough to be grown discreetly. They’re also hardy enough to thrive in most climates, and can produce sizeable yields. Users can anticipate an effect that’s relaxing, but also uplifting and happy. Growth pattern of Blue Bullet AutomaticBlue Bullet Automatic cannabis seeds are an indica / sativa hybrid. The seeds are autoflowering, which means that the plants will enter the flowering period at a defined point in their growth, rather than being influenced by the hours of light. This makes them far more predictable in terms of harvesting. Autoflowering seeds also have the advantage of being hardy enough to be cultivated in most climates, even those with cooler, shorter summers. Growers can anticipate an average flowering time with Blue Bullet Auto, which means there’s not too long to wait until harvest-time. The plants are usually compact in height; something that will appeal to growers who want to cultivate them discreetly. In appearance, they’re not dissimilar to a typical indica, with bushy branches. They produce plenty of buds, which results in good-sized yields for an autoflowering strain. However, while growers might not generate super-abundant harvests, the ease-of-growing really does make up for it. Blue Bullet Automatic is now one of the simplest strains to cultivate, even for beginners. It’s resilient and grows well in most climates, even those with colder, shorter summers. Alternatively, the plants can be grown indoors at any time of year. Effect, taste, and smell of Blue Bullet AutomaticBlue Bullet Auto is a sativa / indica hybrid. The influence of its parent plants can be seen in the effect, and in the aroma and taste. Upon consumption, users often comment on the potent effect, which is fairly strong for an automatic strain. It’s relaxing like an indica, but also cerebral and chatty, which is more typical of a sativa. The scent has echoes of Blueberry, with a hint of fruit and sweetness. There’s also a skunky aroma, which intensifies as the plants mature. These flavours are evident in the taste, which also has a note of citrus. In a nutshell Blue Bullet Automatic was originally called Sensi #119, and was renamed by the cannabis communityThe plants are compact enough to be grown discreetly, both inside and outdoorsThe aroma and taste are a blend of sativa and indica; fruity and sweet, with notes of skunkThe high is relaxing and fairly potent for an auto, and is also happy and upliftingAs an auto strain, the plants thrive most climates, and can cope with cooler temperatures</description><meta_title>Blue Bullet Automatic Seeds - Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Blue Bullet Automatic is an indica / sativa hybrid.

Cannabis has long been prized for the strong and durable fiber in its stalks, its edible and oil-rich seeds, and the psychoactive and medicinal compounds produced by its female flowers. The culturally valuable and often irreplaceable goods derived from cannabis deeply influenced the commercial, medical, ritual, and religious practices of cultures throughout the ages, and human desire for these commodities directed the evolution of the plant toward its contemporary varieties. As interest in cannabis grows and public debate over its many uses rises, this detailed hard-cover book helps us understand why humanity continues to rely on this plant and adapts it to suit our needs.Robert C. Clarke is cannabis researcher and Projects Manager for the International Hemp Association in Amsterdam. He is author of "Marijuana Botany" (1981) in which he presented, to both experts and the general public, scientific knowledge and propagation techniques used to preserve and multiply vanishing Cannabis strains. In 1998 Clarke published "Hashish!" , a beautifully illustrated book on the origins, history, consumption, production and chemistry of this substance. The author also collects hemp textiles and has carried out field research in many regions during the past twenty years studying hemp cultivation, processing and weaving from seed to clothing. "Cannabis: Evolution and Ethnobotany" is co-authored with Mark D. Merlin, who is Botany Professor at University of Hawai’i at Manoa and author of "On the Trail of the Ancient Opium Poppy".Authors: R.

The DaVinci’s design focuses on new features for a portable vaporizer. Its compact size, sturdy construction and flexible silicone inhalation tube (the Flexi-Straw) mean that it can easily be stored in a pocket or small bag without the risks of glass components. Storage compartments for oil and herb chambers and a handy multi-tool (all supplied) are innovations bound to please fans of portable vaporizers.Dual power switches ensure the device is not accidentally turned on when not being used to vaporize herbal highs or oils. Power supplied by three rechargeable lithium ion batteries allows for at least 45 minutes of use before needing to be charged. Battery power also eliminates the need for inconvenient butane refills, making this a very clean and simple device and an excellent choice as a medicinal vaporizer.

The active herbal ingredients are vaporized using hot air and the development of harmful substances and aromas are kept to a minimum. The vapour is collected in a balloon, from where it is inhaled. It is ideal for non-smokers.Now the makers of Volcano have introduced a special successor: the Plenty Vaporizer. It may look like an electric tool, but you don't buy this vaporizer for its looks. Plenty is all about results and they don't lie. Plenty is unrivalled when it comes to the volume and intensity of the vapour and the taste and smoothness of the whole experience. The two most decisive characteristics in this regard are: 1. A large herb compartment, even larger than in the Volcano. For single-person use, the Plenty is supplied with various accessories to adapt it. 2. A cooling spiral to cool down the vapour, making for more pleasant consumption.</description><meta_title>Buy Plenty Vaporizer online - Sensi Seeds UK</meta_title><meta_description>Tabletop vaporizer with large filling chamber, for premium vapour production.

For medicinal use in particular, this device is indispensable for convenient, safe and dosed consumption of medicinal cannabis wherever you are.The Ascent line takes the DaVinci range to new heights and raises the bar even higher for this type of vaporizer. The line includes three types with different looks, the black Stealth, the chic Burl Wood and the cool Carbon Fiber.The air channel in each is fully made of glass which promotes the taste and the purity of the vapour. DaVinci hasn't forgotten sustainability; the glass mouthpiece can be slotted inside the vaporizer, keeping it out of harm when in a trouser pocket or bag. Even cleaning has been thought of, as the glass components can be taken apart for easy cleaning.

Look no further! The Mighty vaporizer from Storz &amp; Bickel lives up to its name. The vapour cloud generated by this small yet powerful vaporizer rivals that of bigger (and more expensive) static plug-in ones. Precision programming and feedback Firstly, the Mighty has an easy to read LED display screen recessed into the grips, which protect the screen from knocks and scrapes. Together with the plus and minus keys, this makes controlling the Mighty simple and intuitive. Set the temperature (which can be viewed in Fahrenheit or centigrade) and watch as the actual (rising) temperature is displayed above the set temperature. Once the requested temperature is reached, the Mighty will give two short vibrations to let you know it is ready for use. The heat will self-adjust during use to maintain a consistent temperature, but can also be manually adjusted throughout vaporization for the perfect user experience. Battery power and plug-in option Enjoy a full hour and a half of continuous use from a single two-hour charge, thanks to the Mighty’s twin lithium ion batteries. This is twice as long as the Crafty, and should enable the vaporization of about ten full chambers before a recharge is needed. However, thanks to the dual heating system (see below) the Mighty works just as well with a partially packed filling chamber (unlike solely convection heated vaporizers). You can adjust the amount you wish to vaporize without affecting its performance. The LED screen mentioned above also displays remaining battery power, so you will never be caught by surprise by an empty battery. As an extra bonus, if the batteries are fully discharged, the Mighty converts into a mini tabletop vaporizer and you can continue using it by plugging in the power adaptor. There is an automatic switch off if the Mighty is left unused for over a minute. Convection and conduction heated vaporizing The Mighty, like little sister the Crafty and plug-in model the Plenty, runs on a combination of convection and conduction heating. The full hot air convection heating ensures that vaporization begins immediately and is smooth and continuous, and the conduction heating delivers the vapour at full strength from the first intake of breath. Not only is this very satisfying, it is also very efficient. However, there is another, equally crucial element to the heating cycle, which is the cooling. Vapour that is too hot when it reaches your mouth is less pleasantly flavoured and can irritate the mouth and throat. The Mighty vaporizer incorporates a cooling system above the filling chamber which ensures the vapour reaches your mouth at an optimum temperature for enjoyment of flavours and aromas. Extra tools for extra convenience The Mighty comes with various accessories (see list below), the most innovative of which is the Filling Tool. Similar in appearance to a grinder, this handy device twists open to become a tamper for gently pressing down plant matter in the filling chamber, and a wide funnel which fits onto the chamber. Simply add your chosen vaporizing material to the funnel and it slips easily into the chamber. Remove the funnel and use the tamper to gently pack the plant matter. Anyone suffering from pain, cramps, arthritis etc in their hands will find this tool makes a real difference to the ease of filling a vaporizer. A Volcano in your pocket Both the Mighty and the Plenty are Sensi Seeds staff favourites, and you can be sure we have rigorously tested them. Described by one member of staff as “Like having a Volcano Digital in your pocket!”, the Mighty is a vaporizer that will more than repay your investment in terms of usability, efficiency and durability.

Looking for a small, durable, stealthy and above all effective portable vaporizer? The Crafty is what you need! It’s a Sensi Seeds staff favourite, integrating high-end tech features with classic usability to give exceptional value for money and hours of vaping pleasure. Crafty by name and crafty by nature, it is the must-have gadget for on the go cannabis use. Compact enough to easily fit into a pocket or small handbag, the Crafty delivers clouds of vapour usually only achievable with tabletop vaporizers. It features the solid construction and ergonomic design that have made manufacturers Storz and Bickel the premium name in vaping, with a range of features that cater to the needs of the most demanding user. Intelligent design and efficient use The Crafty vaporizer is cased in tough, durable plastic with non-slip grips. The mouthpiece swivels for use or storage positions. Together with the slimline design of the one-touch, single button control and temperature indicating LED, this ensures that the Crafty slips smoothly from hand to bag without snagging (very useful for truly crafty use!). The top section clicks and twists off for filling the chamber. Storz and Bickel demonstrate their understanding of their field once again with the inclusion of their new filling tool with every Crafty. Medicinal users suffering from muscle spasms or arthritis in their hands will absolutely benefit from this smart accessory. Looking similar to a grinder, this tool is actually a combination of a funnel and a tamper. Click them apart, screw the funnel on to the chamber and fill with your chosen vaping material. Then use the tamper to gently pack it into the chamber. No more wasted crumbs of plant material, and far quicker and easier to achieve a perfectly packed vaporizer than using your fingers! Battery power and charging If you’re looking for the best vaporizer to take to a festival or on holiday, the Crafty is a perfect choice. The Crafty runs on a single lithium-ion battery which provides 30 - 45 minutes of continuous use from a 2 hour charge. The battery is charged via a USB cable, which comes with a country-specific wall adapter. However, one of the Crafty’s best features is that it can be charged from any USB point that delivers 1.4 amp or above, including computers and power banks. One charge supplies enough energy for around five full chamber loads. However, thanks to its heating and cooling technology, there is no need to fill the chamber completely to make the Crafty work. This also enables a more economical use of vaporizing material. Temperature and other controls The Crafty has two pre-set temperatures. Press the button once for 180 degrees centigrade and twice for the ‘booster temperature’ of 195 degrees centigrade. If these temperatures don’t suit your needs, fear not – you can change them. To keep the size of the Crafty to a minimum (it’s about the size of a packet of cigarettes), Storz and Bickel dispensed with the temperature and battery life display screen that features on the Crafty’s big sister, the Mighty. So in another ground-breaking innovation, the Crafty has its own app for Android phones with a Bluetooth Low Energy chip, and iPhone 4S and above OS. Using a Bluetooth connection, you can reprogram the temperatures via your phone and even alter the brightness of the indicator LED. Once the correct temperature has been achieved the LED turns from red to green and the Crafty vibrates twice. The LED also flashes blue to indicate battery charging (full details of all the LED status indicators are found in the Crafty instruction manual). Several Sensi Seeds staff have Crafty vaporizers, and very much recommend them as durable, easy to use, and super effective. Get yours today!

CBD Oil capsules are a new way to enjoy all the benefits of CBD Oil – without the bitter taste.What if you don’t like the taste of CBD oil? Sensi Seeds now offers CBD Oil in a convenient slow-release capsule, designed to resist digestion in the stomach for optimal absorption. Gluten-free and suitable for vegans, Sensi Seeds CBD Oil Capsules are made of hemp leaves produced from EU-certified plants and mixed with hemp seed oil. The hemp plants are grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides, in order to produce a safe product of the highest quality. Each capsule contains approximately 520mg of oil, providing 15mg of CBD. CBDCannabidiol, or CBD, is found naturally in the Cannabis sativa L. plant. Unlike the cannabis constituent THC, it has no psychoactive effects.Sensi Seeds CBD Oil Capsules contain different phytocannabinoids in addition to CBD: CBC (cannabichromene), CBG (cannabigerol), and CBN (cannabinol). They also contain terpenes including: Myrcene, Limonene, Alpha &amp; Beta -pinene, Linalool, B-caryophyllene, Caryophyllene oxide, Humulene, Nerolidol, and Phytol.A convenient CBD capsuleCBD Oil usually comes in a 10 ml or 30 ml bottle with a pipette. Because of its bitter taste some people prefer not to use it in droplets. CBD Oil Capsules are flavourless, easy to take, and they maintain their potency during digestion.Stomach acid tends to degrade CBD into inactive metabolites, rendering it less effective when it reaches the absorption site – the small intestine. Sensi Seeds CBD Oil Capsules are resistant to stomach acid, which means the CBD is not broken down and is absorbed directly by the body.The capsules are made of an extract of industrial hemp leaves from EU registered varieties, mixed with cold pressed organic hemp seed oil. The mixture is encapsulated in a delayed release capsule – a vegan, gluten-free capsule that contains approximately 580mg of oil, including 15mg of CBD.Use and conservationOnce or twice a day, take one capsule with water, 30 minutes before a meal.
